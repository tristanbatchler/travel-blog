  We're an Australian couple in our late-twenties who love to travel. We have two orange cats, Ferris and Goldie. 

  <img src="img/ferris_goldie.jpg" alt="Our cats" style="width:144px;height:144px;" class="rounded-full object-cover mx-auto mb-2" />

  We're also tech nerds, and we built this website ourselves to have a place to easily look back on our travel memories.
