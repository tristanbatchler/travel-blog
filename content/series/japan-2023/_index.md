This documents our trip to Japan in early 2023. It was Soph's first trip overseas, and Tristan's second. Each page is a recollection of our experiences in each city, big and small, and features our recommendations for accommodation, food, and attractions. Each page is smattered with happy snaps from our iPhones and nicer pictures taken on Soph's Sony Î±6400 (stock lens). The nicer photos were edited in Lightroom.

We wrote this blog from transcribed voice notes we recorded every night of our trip. It was a great way to make sure we didn't forget any of the small moments of our trip.

We hope you enjoy it!
