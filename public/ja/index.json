Sadly, it was closed (boo). So, we spent the morning relaxing, packing, drinking tea in the sun room while admiring the clear view of the mountains. The sun had finally come out after days of overcast weather, and we couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe those mountains had been there the entire time.\nWe packed up our room and made sure to grab everything. We should have done a better job, because we discovered later that we left one Soph\u0026rsquo;s SD cards behind that was full of pictures. Luckily we had backed up most of them, but we were still missing pictures from a day or two of our trip. We took one last picture of our room before we left \u0026ndash; it was such an interesting place to stay.\nWe\u0026#39;ve never wanted to go back in time to a picture more, just to get that bloody SD card back! After we checked out at reception, the owner gave us adorable little ribbons with five yen coins to tie to our bags. Before we could turn around and leave, the owner insisted on taking a group photo with us. He set up a digital camera on a timer, and just as it was about to go off, he shouted \u0026lsquo;Monkey!\u0026rsquo; instead of \u0026lsquo;Cheese!\u0026rsquo;. We were caught off guard and didn\u0026rsquo;t say it in time, but we looked at each other and laughed afterwards. He even took another picture because he didn\u0026rsquo;t like how the first one turned out, lol.\nHe even tried to sell us some t-shirts before we left. We politely declined, but in hindsight that would have been a cool souvenir to have. He didn\u0026rsquo;t offer to drive us to the station, which was a relief as we weren\u0026rsquo;t too keen on getting back into his death trap of a car. We were excited to explore more of Tōkyō, but we were also a little sad to be leaving this weird and wonderful place behind.\nAfter walking back to Yudanaka Station (湯田中駅) for the last time, a friendly station attendant helped us purchase our tickets to Nagano. Our train wasn\u0026rsquo;t due to arrive for some time, so we grabbed some pizza buns and hot tea from Lawson for breakfast (nutritious and delicious!). There wasn\u0026rsquo;t a clear line to board the train, people were just kind of huddled in the waiting area, so we were a bit confused. After committing to awkwardly standing at the back of the group, people were eventually allowed through the gates and onto the train.\nOnce on the train, we found that Soph\u0026rsquo;s luggage didn\u0026rsquo;t fit in the overhead compartment. So, we had to sit separately, with Soph next to her luggage. The train ride was a pleasant 45 minutes with some great views.\nWe revived the drawing game we made up before our flight to Japan a few weeks before \u0026ndash; Tristan drew a very accurate portrait of Dave Grohl in just one minute.\nIt belongs in the Lourve! We arrived in Nagano and navigated our way out of the station, got some Shinkansen tickets, and used our JR Pass for the last time. We had to settle for a three-seater as there were no two-seaters left. Thankfully, no one sat next to us, and we enjoyed a peaceful ride.\nWe got off near Tōkyō and transferred to another train to get to our new digs in Shibuya. The ticketing system was a bit confusing, but we managed to figure it out and made it to Shibuya Station without any issues.\nThe station was quite busy \u0026ndash; construction pushed big groups of people into narrow walkways, so it was tricky to navigate through the crowds with our luggage in tow. Soph started feeling a bit off, but we chalked it up to tiredness. We explored the area a bit, had a funny encounter with a security guard who seemed to want to stop us from walking down a particular street. To make matters worse, she was extremely confused when Tristan told her \u0026lsquo;we don\u0026rsquo;t speak English\u0026rsquo; (he meant to say \u0026lsquo;Japanese\u0026rsquo;!).\nWe finally made it back to the last hotel of our trip, Tokyu Stay Shibuya. The room was pretty basic and the location wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as its sister hotel in Shinjuku, but it was right above a Family Mart so at least we had snacks nearby.\nBy this point Soph was feeling worse, so she took a long bath and rested while Tristan unpacked. After some R\u0026amp;R, we ventured out again for some food and shopping. We visited Bic Camera (株式会社ビックカメラ), which was a bit overwhelming with its multiple levels full to the brim with random electronics. We managed to find what we needed and then headed to The Great Burger Stand for dinner.\nThe food was delicious and had a range of plant-based options to choose from. However, Soph was feeling even worse by this point, so we called it a night after we finished our meals and headed back to the hotel.\nOver it! Soph had a rough night, and Tristan didn\u0026rsquo;t sleep much either thanks to the small bed and the loud air conditioning.\nDay 17\nA day of rest # The next morning, Soph still wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling any better. This was annoying because we had pre-booked tickets to teamLabs Planets, an interactive art exhibit that we were both really excited about. After some back and forth, we decided that at least one of us should see it, so Tristan got ready and left Soph to rest. Shortly after he left, Soph had a moment of clarity and checked to see if we could rebook for Friday morning. It turns out that there were tickets available, so we booked them! The date was not ideal as we were flying back to Aus that night, but it was worth it to see the exhibit together. We crossed our fingers that Soph would feel better by then.\nAfter rebooking, Tristan came straight back (with snacks) and we spent the day in the hotel room to give Soph the best chance of a speedy recovery. We watched a few random shows on Netflix \u0026ndash; You People, Chef, and then Julie and Julia. Funny story about Chef \u0026ndash; Tristan showed it to Soph on a whim one day, and she unexpectedly fell head over heels in love with it. She\u0026rsquo;s seen it at least four times since then and will happily watch it with anyone who\u0026rsquo;s never seen it. Highly recommend!\nOther than that, we did manage to venture out for a short walk to Macca\u0026rsquo;s for lunch and enjoyed it next to a nearby stream. Thankfully, Soph was starting to feel a bit better, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to push it.\nDay 18\nStudio Ghibli Museum # The next day, we woke up early because we had tickets to the Ghibli Museum (三鷹の森ジブリ美術館). Soph was finally on the mend, which was a huge relief because it would have been impossible to rebook these tickets. We started our day with our favourite breakfast from Doutor. Thankfully we stopped here before going to the museum as we realised halfway through our meal that we had forgotten our tickets! Luckily our hotel was nearby, so we quickly ducked back in and fished them out of our huge receipt pile. With tickets in hand, we headed off to catch our train at Shibuya Station.\nAfter a quick train journey, we arrived at Mikata (三鷹市), a city in West Tōkyō. The museum was a bit of a walk from the station, but it was a gorgeous day, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t mind.\nAfter a pleasant walk through Inokashira Park (井の頭恩賜公園), we finally made it to the museum! Soph\u0026rsquo;s favourite Ghibli movie is My Neighbour Totoro (となりのトトロ), so when she saw the giant Totoro in the ticket booth, she squealed with delight.\nThe museum\u0026rsquo;s exterior perfectly encapsulated the joy of Ghibli films. The walls were painted with bright colours and the windows were custom made to look like they were straight from the mind of Hayao Miyazaki (宮崎 駿).\nThere were about 100 people lined up, but thankfully it was moving fairly quickly. There was already a line of excited people waiting to get in, and the energy was infectious.\nWe were a bit nervous about whether we would make it inside because we had used a bit of a workaround to get our tickets. Usually, tickets aren\u0026rsquo;t available to foreigners unless you buy them on a specific day online, and they sell out very quickly. But, tickets are much easier to get if you\u0026rsquo;re a Japanese resident, so we used a VPN to trick the website into thinking we were from Japan. We ordered the tickets from the Japanese Studio Ghibli website and picked them up at Lawson\u0026rsquo;s at the start of the trip. Thankfully, our little trick worked, and we got in with no issues. And just like that, we were stepping into the magical world of Studio Ghibli!\nInside the museum, it was like stepping into another world. Sadly we couldn\u0026rsquo;t take any photos inside, but we\u0026rsquo;ll try to describe its magic! The museum spanned three stories and was filled with early drawings and storyboards from classic Ghibli films like Kiki\u0026rsquo;s Delivery Service (魔女の宅急便) and Spirited Away (千と千尋の神隠し). There were also life-size replications of the rooms that the animators drew in, all strewn with original art from the films.\nWe even got to watch a short film about a little spider that lives underwater called Mon Mon the Water Spider (水グモもんもん). It was a sweet little film about a diving bell spider that falls in love with a water strider \u0026ndash; only Studio Ghibli could make a spider cute! Soph loved it so much that she got a keychain with the spider on it. The film is exclusive to the museums, so it felt extra special that we had seen it. It also has no dialogue, so it was accessible for anyone to enjoy, regardless of language. It was a truly unforgettable experience!\nAfter exploring more of the museum, we made our way up the ivy-covered spiral stairs to the roof. It had an enormous statue of the robot from Castle in the Sky (天空の城ラピュタ), which we were allowed to take photos of!\nLuckily for our love of gift shops, theirs was incredible. It was pretty crowded as the shop sells exclusive merchandise that you can\u0026rsquo;t get anywhere else. We took our time looking at all of the adorable trinkets, and because it was exclusive merch, we allowed ourselves to spend a bit more than we usually would. We ended up spending about $150 AUD, which got us a surprisingly sizeable haul. We got a couple of keychains, pens, a magnet, and a few plushies. You know you\u0026rsquo;ve done well when they give you the big bag! We were stoked.\nAfter exploring everything the museum had to offer, we decided to get some lunch at the Straw Hat Café. It\u0026rsquo;s common in Japan to see plastic renditions of everything on a restaurant\u0026rsquo;s menu, but the museum took it one step further and had knitted versions of their dishes. It was so cute and quirky!\nThe museum was a huge highlight of our trip. It was curated to perfection and we were stoked that it had lived up to the hype. We booked our tickets about three months before our trip, and it was definitely worth the wait. It was extra special that we got to experience it together, and we highly recommend it to anyone visiting Japan who loves Studio Ghibli.\nAfter saying our goodbyes to the museum, we took a leisurely stroll through the park before heading back to our hotel. Along the way, we encountered a woman just casually walking her cat on a leash (as you do).\nBut the real stars of our walk were the ducks we spotted in the lake \u0026ndash; we think they were greater scaups. They dived underwater to find a lil snack and re-emerged about ten seconds later in a totally different spot. Some of the ducks that couldn\u0026rsquo;t dive as deep \u0026ndash; they\u0026rsquo;d bob around for a good five seconds or so and then resurface (and presumably ask their Mum if she saw that). We must\u0026rsquo;ve spent twenty minutes just watching them go up and down. It\u0026rsquo;s the little things!\nAfter peeling ourselves away from the ducks, we walked through the rest of the park. The grounds were well-kept (classic Japan) and there were plenty of people out on a stroll despite it being a bit of a dreary day.\nOn the way back to the train station, we visited a few vintage clothing stores along an adorable street. We didn\u0026rsquo;t end up buying anything, but we still enjoyed browsing and seeing what was on offer. We also stumbled upon another B-side label store, the same sticker store we had visited in Ōsaka. We did another round in there, just to make sure we weren\u0026rsquo;t missing out on any cool stickers or t-shirts. The staff were really friendly and even gave us a business card, which is a kind gesture in Japan. We moseyed on back to the train station and headed back to our hotel in Shibuya.\nAfter returning to our hotel room, we decided to take it easy for the rest of the day. We watched a few episodes of Cook at all Costs\u0026quot; on Netflix. Basically, three contestants cook meals at different costs from the same amount of starting money and whoever cooks the best meal wins the money they have left. It was a bit gimmicky, but it was entertaining enough to keep us occupied.\nWe emerged from our hotel in the evening to secure some grub. We weren\u0026rsquo;t super hungry, so we explored Shibuya and took the opportunity to take some nighttime snaps in the city before grabbing dinner.\nAfter working up an appetite, we decided to try out a sushi place for dinner, Katsu Midori. It came highly recommended on Happy Cow (a vegan food app), and we were desperate to have a good selection of vegetarian sushi in Japan. It was a bit of a mission to find the restaurant itself \u0026ndash; it was nestled in a large department building and it took some time to find what level it was on. After a bit of wandering around, we finally found it and joined the long line of people waiting to get in.\nAfter waiting in line for 45 minutes, we were in. It was quite an experience \u0026ndash; the menu was on an iPad and when you ordered something, it would take a while for it to come out. But when it did, it would arrive on a little train that looked like a shinkansen \u0026ndash; adorbs.\nUnfortunately, the vegetarian options were quite limited despite Happy Cow\u0026rsquo;s glowing recommendation, which was disappointing. This trip made us realise that sushi outside of Japan is catered for western tastes, and that includes the vegetarian options. It was a bit annoying waiting so long to get in only to be disappointed.\nAfter dinner, we strolled around Shibuya a little longer before turning it in for the night. Tomorrow is our last full day in Japan, which is bittersweet \u0026ndash; we were sad that our holiday was coming to an end, but we were also ready to return to our routine back in Aus (and our orange guy, of course).\nDay 19\nOur Last Full Day in Japan # We woke up early and decided to revisit Shibuya Hikarie building (渋谷ヒカリエ), a tall building with a great view of the city for free. Unfortunately, the best spots were taken up by people with tripods filming time lapses, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t get to take many photos. But it was still a nice experience.\nWe ventured out to Akihabara (秋葉原) to check it out in the daytime. We visited a few electronics stores, but it was a bit like seeing the Valley in the daytime \u0026ndash; it didn\u0026rsquo;t have the same lustre as it does at nighttime. We still enjoyed the sunshine and even saw this weird sign.\nHair \u0026#39;cut\u0026#39;...seems legit. We decided to visit Asakusa (浅草), a neighbourhood we hadn\u0026rsquo;t explored yet, and hoping to visit some temples and Tōkyō Skytree (東京スカイツリー). We took the train there and found ourselves dropped off right in the middle of a bustling area full of shops and restaurants. It was chock-full of people because we were near Sensō-ji (浅草寺), Tōkyō\u0026rsquo;s oldest temple and one of its most significant (and thus very popular). After wandering around we came across it and were captivated by its beauty, so we decided to explore it.\nIt was incredible to see up close, and many people were taking part in spiritual practices inside the temple. We weren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with how to take part the right way so we chose not to do so, but we watched the rituals from afar and appreciated their significance for so many people.\nAfter about half an hour of exploring the temple, we continued on our exploration of Asakusa. We found ourselves in this bustling shopping street called Nakamise-dori Street (仲見世通り). It was lined with all sorts of shops selling traditional Japanese crafts, snacks, and souvenirs. We had a blast just wandering around, taking in the sights and sounds, and of course, doing a bit of shopping.\nWe explored the area for a bit and decided to cross the river and visit the Tōkyō Skytree. It was a gorgeous day so we soaked up the sun on the walk (which took longer than expected).\nWe eventually made it to the Skytree. It was enormous \u0026ndash; it absolutely towered over the nearby streets. There were heaps of people inside, so we had to wait in line for tickets for about half an hour. We got tickets for both the Tembo Deck (350m high) and the Tembo Galleria (450m high), but had to wait another 20 minutes for our time slot to open. We explored the ground level while we waited and came across this incredible mural that was both very detailed and massive in its scale.\nBefore we knew it, it was time to head up. We were delighted to learn that there were four elevators, and each had its own season theme. We went up in the spring elevator and later on came down in the winter elevator. They were huge and fast \u0026ndash; they could fit up to 40 people and had a max speed of 600m per minute, the fastest elevators in Japan.\nThere are no words for the views that greeted us as we entered the Tembo Deck. Tōkyō is an enormous city, and even though visibility was high that day, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t see the end of it. Sometimes you can get lucky and see Mt. Fuji (富士山), but it was juuust too hazy for us. The deck wraps 360° around the building, so we could see the city from just about every angle. It was breathtaking.\nWe soaked in the views and made our way up to the top floor, Tembo Galleria. The sun was starting to set on the city, and we decided to indulge in a cheeky beverage each at the bar. Definitely the best view we\u0026rsquo;ve ever had while enjoying a drink!\nWhile we were seated there we heard gasps from some of the people sitting a bit further down the bar. We looked over and saw smoke billowing from a building. We were a bit concerned, but the smoke eventually grew smaller so it looked like it was under control. We googled it and after some digging, we eventually found on a Japanese news website that it was coming from a tyre shop and one person was injured. We hope they were ok!\nAfter spending a little more time taking in the views, we headed back down to earth. We were pretty hungry, so we decided to finally try out Japanese Domino\u0026rsquo;s. We\u0026rsquo;d been curious about it for a while, and we were coming to the end of the trip, so why not? Soph ordered the Ultra Cheese and Tristan went for the Big Dack, a burger-themed pizza that\u0026rsquo;s basically a pizza rip-off of the Big Mac. They can\u0026rsquo;t call it that, of course, so they went with Big Dack.\nAfter a short wait, we grabbed our pizzas and found a spot to sit near the Skytree. We found a free table in the surrounding gardens and had a little pizza picnic. It was cold and dark by then, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t mind. Soph even tried maple syrup on her pizza, which was nice but a bit too sweet by the end of her meal.\nSince there are hardly any bins in Japan, we had to carry our pizza boxes around in our bag. We then climbed four giant sets of stairs to get to the ice skating rink. It was quite expensive - ¥4,200 for everything (about $43 AUD), including socks and gloves, the skates, and the entry fee. The price was a bit steep, but we realised we only had one chance in our lives to ice skate at night at the base of the Tōkyō Skytree, so we went for it.\nThe staff were lovely and helped us find our shoe sizes with ease. We got a ¥100 coin locker for our bag and shoes, put on our skates, and made our way onto the rink.\nSo graceful. To say we were humbled by the ice is an understatement. Tristan\u0026rsquo;s shoes didn\u0026rsquo;t fit right so after a lap or two his feet were in a punish. Soph on the other hand won the award for the worst skater of the day. She only managed one lap and was holding on to the side of the rink the entire time. The poor instructor was trying to help, but it just was not gonna happen. After two laps of the small rink, we decided to call it a day.\nWe returned our skates, got our stuff back, and took some photos and videos with the Skytree before we left. It was just as beautiful at night \u0026ndash; it changed colours every few minutes.\nOn our way out, we discovered a random Studio Ghibli store, Donguri Republic (as if we needed an excuse to get more Ghibli-themed souvenirs). The store itself was super cool \u0026ndash; it had a giant catbus in the window with its eyes lit up and an equally giant Totoro inside. It was full of all sorts of Ghibli merch, and luckily we still had some money left in our souvenirs budget. Soph got a Kiki\u0026rsquo;s Delivery Service headband and we also got a Spirited Away surprise capsule toy (a very restrained haul).\nAfter leaving the store, we spotted a Sizzler in a tall building across the river! So you\u0026rsquo;re telling me that Toowoomba\u0026rsquo;s Sizzler had to shut down, but the one in Tōkyō is alive and well? What a bizarre world we live in.\n(I wonder if they sell cheese toast...) After a short walk, we hitched a ride on the subway back to Shibuya. It was a direct line from the Skytree, which was handy because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to switch trains. We even managed to get seats, which is a rare luxury on subways.\nBack in Shibuya, we stopped at a FamilyMart for some drinks. We sat outside the FamilyMart one last time before we leave, just like we used to do when we first got here. We explored Shibuya at night again (Japan at night just hits different, alright?) and soaked in our last night in the country. We had mixed feelings about leaving, but we were so grateful to have the opportunity to explore such an incredible place.\nBack at the hotel, we had a nice bath each and settled into bed. We had a big day of travel coming up, so we needed as much sleep as we could manage.\nDay 20\nLast day in Japan and teamLab Planets # Our last day in Japan started with a bit of a laundry mishap. We had put a load of washing in the night before to minimise the amount of washing we needed to do when we got home to Aus. We hoped it would be dry by morning, but we accidentally forgot to put in on a dry cycle after washing them.\nTristan woke up in a panic, realising our clothes were still wet and that we needed to pack up our clothes within two hours. In a rush, he put it on what he thought was a dry cycle, but it turned out to be another wash cycle. Now our clothes were even wetter than before!\nI\u0026#39;m convinced Hell is just billions of these stupid machines, everywhere you look. With a full load of sopping wet clothes and a ticking clock, we had to think on our feet. The wet clothes were not ideal because they would make our bags too heavy for the plane, plus who wants wet clothes in their suitcase for 24 hours? We eventually devised a plan; we would check out, have our hotel hold our bags for us while we went to teamLabs, then pick them back up in the afternoon to dry them properly at a laundromat. We packed up our clothes in a few plastic bags, hoping that would keep the water out of our dry belongings, and packed up our suitcases.\nAfter checking out, we left our luggage, heavy with wet clothes, with the hotel staff. They were super chill about it, and as we left we tried not to think about the possibility of the clothes leaking all over their floor while we were gone. We headed out into the snowy streets of Shibuya, which was a cool experience as we hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen snow in Tōkyō before. We grabbed our final cheese toast breakfast at Doutour and then made our way to Shibuya Station. We hopped on a couple of trains and even got to ride the monorail to teamLabs, which was such a cool experience.\nWe were welcomed to teamLabs by a huge line of people waiting to get in. It was also raining, which isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal when you have to line up outside. We waited in the rain for about 20 minutes before we were allowed in. Once inside, we were ushered into a black room where we had to take off our shoes and store our belongings in a locker. The only things we kept with us were our phones and cameras.\nWe walked in to the exhibit together with around 100 other people. It was pretty crowded, but people walked through the exhibits at their own pace, so it didn\u0026rsquo;t always feel super cramped.\nThe first part of the exhibit was the water section. We walked up a small hill with water rushing down our feet, which perfectly set the tone for the whole experience. The feeling of water rushing on our tired feet was an instant mood-booster. The walkways between the rooms were dark, with only red lights at the bottom to guide our way.\nThe first room was a big pillowy room that was tricky to walk across. It was soft and easy to fall into, which was really fun and comfy (until you were breathless from something kids do for fun). After fighting for our life to make it across, we eventually made it to the other side.\nThe next room was huge and filled with knee-deep water that had projections of koi fish. It was incredible, and even more so knowing that the projections were based off where we were in the water, so the fish would swim away from us if we got too close. Most of the rooms have some kind of projection or light show that is algorithm-based and reactive to people moving around in the room, so every time you go to the exhibit, you see something different. As people who know a little about computer programming, it boggles the mind to think about what the programs running these exhibits must look like.\nNext we went into a room with every surface covered in mirrors, with long strips of LEDs hanging from the ceiling. The strips were super close together with only a couple of paths through the room, and the lights flickered and changed colour. These lights were also controlled by an algorithm-based program, so it was cool to think that we would be the only people to see the lights change in this exact way.\nThis is the room that is most popular on social media, so every single person was taking photos and selfies. They were also walking really slowly through the exhibit so it was hard to move around, so much so that the poor staff had to usher us along (an urgency that is very uncommon in Japan).\nAfterwards, we moved on to a dark room with an incredible projection of flowers on the ceiling. It was round-shaped, and we laid on the ground and just soaked it all in. It was a borderline meditative experience.\nNext, we headed to a room filled with enormous opaque spheres that were lit up with beautiful colours. You could even push some of the balls and almost kick them around.\nThe second last room was outdoors. It had a moss floor and bunch of space-like silver blobs. It was a bit underwhelming considering the crazy sensory experiences we had just had, but it was still cool to see. It was also raining which deterred most people from spending too much time there.\nHi from space! The final room was the orchid room, which was another mirror room that had real, living orchids hanging from the ceilings. The orchids were raised and a large group of people would go in, and after everyone sat on the ground, the orchids would be lowered. It was like you were in the middle of the coolest floral rainforest. It was incredible to see in person.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re heading to Tōkyō, this has to be on your list of places to visit. It\u0026rsquo;s usually the first thing everyone recommends, and for good reason! It is totally worth the money, just make sure you bring comfy shorts.\nWe said goodbye to teamLabs and rode the monorail on our way back to Shibuya. The monorail was such a cool experience the first time and we were glad we got to do it again on the way back.\nWe made it back and were in a bit of a rush to sort out our laundry debacle, but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do so without lunch (of course), so we stopped at the tried-and-true Great Burger Stand before heading back to the hotel. We ordered the same thing we had last time (which was delish), and to Tristan\u0026rsquo;s (definitely not Sophie\u0026rsquo;s) delight, the restaurant played Stinkfist by Tool (one of his all-time favourite songs). They must\u0026rsquo;ve knew we were coming!\nAfter collecting our luggage from the hotel, we found a nearby laundromat to dry our clothes. We had to lug our luggage (we see why it\u0026rsquo;s called luggage now) for about 15 minutes up and down hills in the rain, but we eventually made it to the laundromat. Luckily no water seeped onto our dry belongings in the suitcase, and the place was empty, so we could take up as much room as we wanted. We shoved the clothes into two driers to hopefully save time and crossed our fingers.\nGuess who was more hopeful that this would work. The laundry mishap was a bit of a bummer because it ate into so much of our last day in Japan. We were also absolutely drenched from the freezing rain we had to walk through to get to the laundromat. Despite that, we were convinced that the hard part was over, so we were in a much better mood.\nThankfully, the laundromat did its job and our clothes were perfectly dry with some time to spare. Tristan even used a special machine to dry his shoes, which were grimaced at by a Japanese Mum who wanted to dry her shoes later on.\nAt around 3:30 pm, our suitcases were packed and we headed off to Shibuya Station to catch a train to the airport. Our flight was at 9:00 pm, so at this point we had a little over 5 hours before our plane left. We were feeling the time crunch, but we were confident we\u0026rsquo;d make it.\nWe got to the gate and tried to purchase a train ticket, but loh and behold we didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough cash on us and of course there wasn\u0026rsquo;t an ATM in sight. We were deep in the station, so poor Tristan had to sprint to a not-so nearby convenience store to get some cash. The ATM there had a minimum withdrawal amount of ¥10,000 (about $100 AUD), which was way more than we needed, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to find another ATM. Tristan eventually returned with the cash and we were able to purchase our tickets.\nThat mishap wasn\u0026#39;t so bad, right?... By the time we made it to the platform we only had four hours to go, which was a bit concerning considering we still had to catch our train, check in at the airport, and get through customs. Thankfully, the train was running on time (thanks, Japanese efficiency!) and we boarded without issue. There were plenty of seats on the train, so we settled in and enjoyed our last Japanese train trip for a while.\nBy 6:30 pm, we had finally made it to Narita Airport. It was a long trek to our terminal, but we eventually made it. We struggled to find the check-in desk, and our confusing pacing back and forth prompted a friendly airport worker to direct us to the Jetstar check-in counter that was tucked behind the domestic check-in area. We were a bit nervous about checking in our bags because we thought they would be too heavy, but to our surprise they weren\u0026rsquo;t even close to the weight limit. We checked in with no dramas and headed to customs.\nThankfully, customs wasn\u0026rsquo;t too busy and we were able to get through without much hassle. Tristan was pulled aside after his carry-on was scanned because he had forgotten to take out a small carton of sake that we intended to bring home as a gift for his brother, but sadly no fluids of that size were allowed in carry-on luggage, so we had to discard it.\nWe were starving by this point, so we stopped in the cafeteria to grab some dinner. We were so relieved to have made it through customs in time, considering the hectic day we had just had. The hard part was over now, and bar a cancelled flight or airport evacuation, there was nothing that could prevent us from making our flight.\nAfter dinner, the time had come to say goodbye to our trusty Pocket Wi-Fi. We carried it around every day on our trip, and it made it so easy to connect to the internet regardless of where we were in the country. If you\u0026rsquo;re travelling to Japan, we highly recommend that you rent one for your trip. We rented ours online from Japan Wireless before our trip, picked it up from the airport when we arrived, and put it in the post box at the airport in the reply paid envelope once we connected to the airport Wi-Fi before our flight home.\nWe were so happy with it that we were kind of sad to see it go. It had served us well on our trip, and we made sure to give it a good send off.\nBefore we knew it, it was time to board and we were on the plane home. We felt so grateful to experience such an incredible trip, and it was even better that we shared it together. We were sad that our trip was over, but we were also excited to return home to some normalcy and to see Ferris again. Japan was obviously sad to see us go, since it was raining as we left.\nAfter a nine-hour flight with minimal sleep and bare-minimum food, we eventually made it to the Gold Coast Airport. Australia welcomed us back with clear, sunny weather. It was a sight for sore eyes after an uncomfortable flight!\nWe were one of the first people off the plane, so we only had to wait in the customs line for about 20 minutes. We used a self-serve machine to process our passports and paperwork, and then we were on our way to collect our bags. They came out pretty quickly, and we wasted no time getting the hell out of the last transport-related building of our journey. Soph\u0026rsquo;s Dad wasn\u0026rsquo;t too far behind and picked us up in no time.\nWe celebrated being back on home soil with a Maccas brekky \u0026ndash; god it was good. Soph\u0026rsquo;s Dad drove us home and we bored him with endless stories (he took it like a champ), and he dropped us off to pick up Tristan\u0026rsquo;s car from his brother\u0026rsquo;s place. We hopped in and drove home where we were finally reunited with our orange guy.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it for our first Japan trip! We hope you enjoyed reading our little blog about our favourite trip we\u0026rsquo;ve ever taken (so far!). We will definitely be back to see this beautiful country.\nさようなら (Goodbye)!\n","date":"6 2月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cities/tokyo-return/","section":"Cities","summary":"","title":"Tōkyō • 東京","type":"cities"},{"content":"","date":"4 2月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hiroshima/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hiroshima","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 2月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/kyoto/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kyoto","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 2月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/osaka/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Osaka","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 2月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/yamanouchi/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Yamanouchi","type":"tags"},{"content":" Day 14\nThe long trip to Yamanouchi (山ノ内) # We woke up bright and early in Hiroshima, bags packed and ready for our long journey to Yamanouchi (山ノ内). We were not looking forward to train-hopping all day, especially after having such a blast in Hiroshima, but we were excited about our adventure in the snow.\nSo sad to leave Hiroshima! We hopped on the tram from our hotel to Hiroshima station, then took a train to Shin-Kobe, and another from Shin-Kobe to Nagoya (名古屋).\nNagoya Station was a bit of a whirlwind. We were hungry and decided to grab some Maccas, but the station was confusing so it was tricky to find. We must have looked like lost gaijin (foreigners) because a kind man approached us and led us there. He didn\u0026rsquo;t speak much English, and our Japanese is pretty basic, but we managed to communicate and make some small talk. We weren\u0026rsquo;t sure why this stranger was helping us, but it became clear when we arrived near the restaurant. He opened his bag, revealing a McDonald\u0026rsquo;s employee uniform, and proudly said \u0026lsquo;manager\u0026rsquo;. We replied with a hearty \u0026lsquo;sugoi!\u0026rsquo; (すごい, \u0026lsquo;amazing\u0026rsquo; in English) and thanked him for his help. He left the restaurant shortly after, which means he went far out of his way to help us. What a legend!\nTristan couldn\u0026#39;t resist the Samurai Burger. After our Maccas adventure, we hopped on another train to Nagano (長野). We had a bit of a funny moment when an older lady sitting next to us decided to move seats after we started chatting. We also had a bit of a panic when we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find our train, but a kind local helped us out.\nFinally, we arrived in Nagano, a modern station that hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998 (not that you would ever guess from the Olympics-themed paraphernalia that was absolutely everywhere). We found the Yudanaka line, which was hidden away in a dodgy area underneath the station. It was a tiny train, mostly filled with foreigners like us, heading to the Snow Monkey Park and the ski slopes.\nAfter such a massive day of travel, we finally arrived in Yudanaka at around 5:30 p.m. (we left Hiroshima at 6:00 am!). It was dark and snowy, so the roads were difficult to navigate as they were covered in ice and hard to see. We had to walk uphill to our hotel, which was a bit of a struggle with our suitcases.\nAfter struggling up the hill, we finally made it to our accommodation, Shimaya. It was a small ryokan complete with tatami flooring, futons, and an onsen. The owner was an interesting man who spoke limited English, but was keen to help us however he could. After checking us in, he offered to help us with our bags up the stairs. We politely declined (he was pretty old after all), but this turned out to be a mistake. We were on the fourth floor and there was no elevator, and after the day we had, it was a slog.\nEventually, we made it to our room and were greeted by a spacious, traditional space. The room came with yukatas and tea, which we were keen to try. The bathroom left a bit to be desired, but it was clean and functional, so it had that going for it at least.\nAfter settling in, we were itching to explore the town and eat a proper meal. We had a bit of a scare when Sophie slipped on an icy mat leaving the ryokan. She was okay, but it was quite scary considering how close she came to hitting her head on the tiled step. With a new appreciation for the dangers of icy streets (and our fragile mortality), we headed out to find some dinner, and found a lovely place called Hakko. We enjoyed a mushroom and green onion pizza, butterfries (potato wedges drowned in butter), mackerel, and gyoza.\nWe were in a restaurant, enjoying our meal, when we overheard a conversation between an Australian man, a Canadian woman, a Canadian man, and a European woman (all of whom were middle-aged). The Canadian man dominated the conversation, his loud voice filling the restaurant. As they left, he kept loudly repeating \u0026rsquo;number one, number one\u0026rsquo; to the poor waiter. Seeing how they acted made us feel like we were doing a good job of being respectful in Japan.\nAfter paying for dinner and dropping some \u0026lsquo;gochisousamadeshita\u0026rsquo;s (ご馳走様でした, thank you for the meal), we headed to Lawson, picked up some beer, and returned to our hotel. On our way back, we saw a sign for a restaurant called Mikasa. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an inside joke, but basically there is a creator on TikTok, itslorlo, who plays a cringey male character that is obsessed with his fake Japanese girlfriend, Mikasa. It was such a funny coincidence and we were beside ourselves.\nBack at the hotel, we tried on our yukatas and enjoyed some tea. It was a lovely experience, and we felt like we were truly immersing ourselves in the culture.\nDay 15\nExploring Yudanaka # We woke up the next morning, unsure of our plans for the day, but decided to play it by ear. At least we woke up to a gorgeous view!\nWe got a wake-up call from a rotary phone in our room from the owner of the ryokan, who we\u0026rsquo;ve been calling Yudanaka Joe (in honour of Ōsaka Joe). He asked if we were going to the monkey park. We told him we were planning on going skiing instead, and he offered to drive us to the bus station where we could catch the free shuttle to the ski slope. The drive was a bit chaotic, with Sophie\u0026rsquo;s seatbelt getting stuck in the door and Yudanaka Joe driving like a maniac on the icy roads, but we made it to bus station in one piece.\nWe arrived at the bus station barely in time, thanks to Yudanaka Joe\u0026rsquo;s maniacal driving. We squeezed ourselves onto the bus with a bunch of ski bums and enjoyed the incredible scenery on the ride up the mountain. It was a bit scary as the bus barely fit on the icy, slim road.\nAfter a short ride, we made it to the Shiga Kogen Ski Resort (志賀高原). Our plan was to rent equipment, book a lift pass and take skiing lessons. Tristan had emailed a ski coach about free lessons on the mountain as neither of us had skied before. When we arrived it was all quite confusing, and we hadn\u0026rsquo;t properly planned this out, so it was extra hard to work this out on the fly. After speaking to a few staff members, we decided that we had probably bit off more than we could chew, and called time on our plans to ski.\nIt was a bit disappointing, mainly because we had come all the way to Yudanaka to ski. However, we pivoted and reframed this part of the trip as our first experience in a snowy town. We chose this area because it\u0026rsquo;s also home to the snow monkeys, and since we had a new hole in our calendar, we decided to go there instead. Before heading off, we took some time to enjoy the beautiful views and take some photos.\nAfter about an hour of exploring, it was time to take the bus back down. At the Yudanaka bus station to the monkey park, we overheard a man arguing with the station attendant about the need for the bus company to accept card payments. We overheard something about him nearly being stranded in the mountains because he didn\u0026rsquo;t have cash, but the whole thing seemed too bizarre to not be an overreaction. It was weird because you don\u0026rsquo;t often see Japanese people show emotion, let alone such a big angry outburst. Eventually we snapped out of our eavesdropping and got our bus tickets to the monkey park. The bus station is right in the middle of town, which was covered in snow. It became even more beautiful when the sun starting peeking through the clouds.\nOnce the bus arrived, we noticed people onboarding would take a paper ticket out of a dispenser on the bus, near the door. We had prepaid tickets, so we weren\u0026rsquo;t sure if we meant to take tickets too, but we decided to take a paper ticket each just in case. We ended up with four tickets and a lot of confusion. Why were some people not taking tickets? Were we even on the right bus?\nAfter we arrived, we learned that if you had a prepaid ticket, you didn\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about the paper tickets from the machine inside the bus \u0026ndash; you just needed to ensure that you were on the right bus. If you get a paper ticket, you pay in cash on the bus as you leave. The price depends on how far you go on the bus.\nWe had a bit of a hold-up when a group of American tourists in front of us had to pay with cash. They seemed a bit confused about the process, and we all had to wait for them to figure it out. It was relieving to watch foreigners that weren\u0026rsquo;t us making mistakes as it made us feel less alone, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t mind the holdup. The views at the drop-off point were beautiful!\nAfter we got off the bus, we realised that we had to hike 2.7 km to get to the monkey park. It was a bit challenging because there was ice all over the road, but we took our time and made it there in our own time. We stopped at a café along the way and enjoyed some delicious food. Tristan reckoned that their chicken was even better than KFC! After refuelling, we continued our hike and made our way to the snow monkey entrance. The last kilometre or so was flat and surrounded by snowy trees, which made us feel like we were in a winter wonderland.\nOne very strange thing we saw on the walk up to the monkey park was a fully nude man bathing in an outdoor hot spring which belonged to the Korakukan Ryokan, which was nestled in the valley of mountains along the way. The monkeys had full access to the water, so it was probably filled with god knows what \u0026ndash; we were concerned about the hygiene of the water, but also kind of impressed by this absolute chad.\nAfter walking for an hour and a half (ish), we finally made it to the entrance to the Jigokudani Monkey Park (地獄谷野猿公苑). We purchased our tickets for ¥800 each and made our way through the park. The monkeys mainly stick to the hot spring and river areas, so we had to walk through some snowy sections to see them.\nSeeing the monkeys made all the confusion and challenges of the day worth it. They were everywhere \u0026ndash; foraging in the snow, climbing on the netting on the side of the mountains, and of course, bathing in the hot springs. We were able to get some great photos and videos of these adorable creatures, and were a bit envious of the natural hot tub they had to themselves.\nThe place was absolutely packed with tourists and photographers. The monkeys didn\u0026rsquo;t give a single shit about anybody \u0026ndash; they would just run around looking for bugs to eat. Some preferred to just sit in the hot springs, while others would spend more time foraging in the snow.\nAfter spending about an hour so with the monkeys, we decided it was time to head back. The hike back through the forested area was beautiful in the afternoon sun.\nThere was one section that was about 5 metres of decline \u0026ndash; some people navigated it with ease (probably snowboarders), while others clung onto the railing for dear life (like us, hehe). There was a sign warning people to take extra care down the slope, but some people still went tits up.\nWe stopped at the same café on the way down for some ramen and apple pie. The attention to detail was immaculate!\nAfter our late lunch, we walked a little further and caught the bus back to our accommodation. This time we had to pay with coins, but we had figured out the system by then. After we returned to our hotel, we enjoyed some downtime on our balcony (a rarity in Japan) wearing our yukatas and drinking tea while watching the sunset.\nDinner time was suddenly upon us, and we were a little flustered as there weren\u0026rsquo;t many plant-based options in Yudanaka. However, we had spotted a restaurant earlier that day, Izakaya Kushidoraku, and decided to give it a try. The menu outside looked promising, with vegetable tempura being the main menu item that caught Soph\u0026rsquo;s eye.\nWe were unsure about the shoe etiquette, as Japanese restaurants often require patrons to take their shoes off before coming inside. Tristan bravely asked some locals, who were smoking outside the restaurant, if shoes were okay (Kutsu wa daijōbudesuka, 靴は大丈夫ですか), and they assured us they were. But as soon as we stepped in, we saw everyone\u0026rsquo;s shoes were off! We quickly asked the owner, who kindly reassured us that shoes were fine in the wooden floorboard area. Phew!\nReady to get stuck in to the extensive menu, we claimed the bench at the bar. Just as we sat down, the owner gestured for one of us to move to the other bench. We were a bit confused, but we complied. We ended up sitting the same distance apart, just on separate benches. It felt a bit odd, but the owner probably just wanted to make sure we were comfortable given we take up a bit more space than the average Japanese person.\nWe ordered a variety of potato and chicken dishes, excited to try authentic Japanese cuisine. The food was absolutely delicious, and we washed it down with a couple of drinks. The restaurant was mostly empty except for a lively group of locals, their laughter and chatter adding to the warm atmosphere. We didn\u0026rsquo;t understand a word, but we loved seeing such an animated group of Japanese people (who are usually very reserved).\nAfter a hearty meal, we made our way back to our accommodation, navigating the icy roads. When we got back to our accommodation, we were greeted by the owner, who asked about our checkout time. We weren\u0026rsquo;t sure yet, so we decided to call it a night and figure it out in the morning. We each had a long shower \u0026ndash; it had been such a big day and the warm water was very relaxing.\nThis shower was narrower than it looks. We loved seeing the snow monkeys and experiencing a snowy Japanese town, but we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend staying overnight in Yamanouchi unless you\u0026rsquo;re an experienced skier or have someone in your group that knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing. In hindsight, we would\u0026rsquo;ve taken an extra day in Hiroshima instead and just visited the snow monkeys on a day trip. If you\u0026rsquo;re planning a similar trip, we would recommend staying in Nagano instead and visiting the monkeys on a day trip. You could even do a day trip from Tōkyō, but it would be a long day.\n","date":"4 2月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cities/yamanouchi/","section":"Cities","summary":"","title":"Yamanouchi • 山ノ内","type":"cities"},{"content":" Day 12\nOff to Hiroshima • 広島市 # We woke up feeling a little dusty from the night before, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t helped by an underwhelming hotel breakfast. We packed up (we were getting good at this by this point!) and left for Hiroshima (広島市). On our way into the station, we saw about ten police officers running through the station. We never found out why, but in a country with people who are usually quite reserved, it was weird to see.\nEventually we boarded our Shinkansen and couldn\u0026rsquo;t get seats directly next to each other, but we managed to snag aisle seats in the same row.\nWe had quite the adventure on our train ride to the hotel. We shared a tram carriage with a group of Australian travellers who looked like they were ready for a camping expedition with their massive backpacks. When we reached our stop, Tristan tried to tap off with his suica card, but we don\u0026rsquo;t think it worked properly. He got off anyway, only to realise he had gotten off at the wrong stop. The whole tram watching, including a Japanese old man who laughed out loud.\nWe finally made it to our hotel, The Knot Hiroshima, which was right outside the tram stop. The hotel was super fancy, with the reception on the top floor and a beautiful restaurant on the bottom floor. We were a bit early for check-in, but they let us in anyway since the room was ready. The check-in process took some time, with the staff explaining the many rules and services, but we were just eager to get to our room.\nWe were surprised when they asked us if we wanted a room on the top or bottom floor. We obviously chose the top floor, and boy, was it a good choice! Our room was beautiful, and we had a stunning view of the Peace Dome from the 13th floor.\nSince we only had one full day in Hiroshima, we decided to visit the Peace Museum that afternoon. The museum was a short walk from our hotel, and the view of the river on our way was beautiful. Along the esplanade there were many plaques and memorials, and we stopped to read a few of them. Many of them were adorned with beautiful paper cranes, a symbol of peace that emerged after the bombings.\nAfter a short walk, we arrived at the museum. It\u0026rsquo;s part of the Peace Memorial Park, which is a serene area with many memorials and monuments. The museum itself was a sobering experience, with graphic images and stories of the impact of the bomb on Hiroshima and Japan. Around 140,000 people died in the bombing, and the museum did a great job of honouring their memory and educating visitors about the horrors of nuclear warfare.\nWe also visited the gardens, the Cenotaph, the Children\u0026rsquo;s Peace Monument, and the Eternal Flame. We didn\u0026rsquo;t go up to the Peace Dome as it was getting late, but we got a good view from across the river.\nOn our way back, Sophie had a bit of a tumble and landed hard on her shins. It was painful, but she was okay. Thankfully there was a random orange juice stand nearby, so we got some juice as consolation.\nWe explored the area around our hotel in search of an HDMI cable so that we could connect our laptop to the TV in our room. Tip for travellers \u0026ndash; bring one with you if you know you won\u0026rsquo;t watch the local TV! We didn\u0026rsquo;t end up finding a cable, but at least we got some cool pics of Hiroshima at night.\nFor dinner, we went to the Italian restaurant in our hotel, MORETHAN. Soph opted for a margherita pizza while Tristan bravely tried spaghetti with oysters and bacon. We washed it all down with a limoncello gin and tonic for Soph and a Moscow mule for Tristan. The food was delicious, but the timing was a bit off \u0026ndash; the pizza arrived a good 15 minutes before the spaghetti. We also shared a tiramisu for dessert, which was beyond delicious and the perfect way to cap off our meal.\nAfter dinner, we headed to the hotel\u0026rsquo;s rooftop bar, Kei, where we exchanged our room tokens for drinks and nibbles. It was a smart system \u0026ndash; tokens could be exchanged for money and drinks cost a certain amount of tokens, so you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about finding the right change.\nWe soaked in the vibes, enjoyed a few more drinks, and then headed back to our room. Tristan indulged in a long bath while Soph promptly fell asleep.\nDay 13\nMiyajima/Itsukushima • 宮島 # The next morning, Tristan was up early to secure our ferry tickets to Miyajima (宮島). We went with Hiroshima World Heritage River Cruise, which is super easy to find as it\u0026rsquo;s on the river near the Peace Memorial Park. He spoke to a rather intimidating Japanese man at the ticket office who seemed to grow impatient with his indecisiveness about our return time. With hindsight, he was probably just trying to be efficient. Tristan picked a time, bought our tickets, and brought back a coffee from 7-Eleven for Soph (we love a thoughtful king).\nWe made it to the boat with time to spare, so we sat by the river, enjoying the serenity of the esplanade before our journey. Before long it was time to board, and the 40-minute boat ride was pretty chill.\nOnce we arrived at Miyajima, we were greeted by the sight of the island\u0026rsquo;s famous floating torii gate and our first deer sighting. They were everywhere! We were under strict instruction not to feed them, and we soon learnt why \u0026ndash; they are super nosy and will almost tackle you to the ground for food.\nAfter seeing the floating gate, we visited the centuries-old Itsukushima Shrine (厳島神社) nearby. A sizeable section of the building was obscured by scaffolding, but the main facade was unobstructed. The tide was high at the time we visited, so the temple appeared to float on top of the water. It was a beautiful sight, especially with the mountains in the background.\nWe walked around the lower part of the island, taking in the sights and sounds. And by sounds, we mean the sound of deer \u0026ndash; they sound like whiny babies when they fight. We visited the Daisho-in Temple at the base of the mountain, and despite being at the base of the mountain, we still had to climb an ungodly amount of steps to get there. Once we got to the top, there were many Japanese people there praying and paying their respects. We didn\u0026rsquo;t participate as we aren\u0026rsquo;t spiritual people and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to inadvertently disrespect the traditions.\nAfter a lunch of hot chips for Sophie and pork on a stick for Tristan, we embarked on a hike to a cable car, or \u0026lsquo;rope car\u0026rsquo; as it\u0026rsquo;s called here, to the Mount Misen (弥山) lookout. It was an incredible view \u0026ndash; we could see all of Hiroshima, the ocean, and the surrounding islands.\nOur original plan was to just use the cable car to get to the first lookout, but we were too tempted to hike the extra 500 metres to the summit. The climb was easy because, like we said, we\u0026rsquo;re fit gods\u0026hellip;just kidding. It was tough, but we made it. They say couples don\u0026rsquo;t really know each other until they\u0026rsquo;ve moved in together, but we would like to add \u0026lsquo;hiking together\u0026rsquo; to that phrase. You see a new side to your partner when they\u0026rsquo;re exhausted and sweaty.\nReaching the summit was a moment of pure triumph for us. We were beyond exhausted, but the breathtaking views made every step worthwhile.\nOn the walk there, we met a lovely group of Aussies. We bonded over our mutual exhaustion and the relief of hearing an Aussie accent in Japan. They overtook us, but we saw them again at the summit. They were taking selfies on just their phones, so Soph offered to take some pictures of them on her nice camera and airdropped them on the spot. Sony cameras can send photos to phones on the same Wi-Fi, so Soph used that to send the pics to her phone, which she then airdropped to the Aussies. It was a pretty seamless process despite our VPN getting in the way (a running theme on this trip). Thanks, modern technology!\nThis journey is teaching us so much about ourselves and the world around us. We\u0026rsquo;re learning to navigate unfamiliar situations, to push ourselves beyond our comfort zones, and to appreciate the beauty of new experiences. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but feel a bit proud of ourselves for embarking on this adventure, and we were grateful that we had each other to share it with.\nThat\u0026#39;s going straight to the poolroom! We decided to head back down the mountain, passing the same group of Aussies we\u0026rsquo;d met earlier. They jokingly suggested we should follow them around for the rest of their trip, taking photos for them. The descent was tough because our legs were so weak from the hike up, but we were grateful to Isaac Newton and the laws of physics that we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to go against gravity on the way down too.\nWe hopped on a packed cable car to head back down. The views were breathtaking. Once we got off, we walked through the park, spotting some deer and koi fish along the way. We grabbed some hot chips and a skewer of pork tongue (which was surprisingly good) before heading back to the floating gate.\nWe realized it was low tide and we could walk out to the gate. It was a bit muddy, but we managed to get some great photos.\nHowever, when we turned around, we found our path was slightly flooded as the tide was coming back in quickly. Soph braved the water with her shoes on, but Tristan decided to take his shoes and socks off. He quickly regretted his decision when we got back to the path, and he realised there was no grass to walk on, just dirt. We had a boat to catch soon, so he had no choice but to put his muddy feet into his socks and shoes.\nTime got away from us, and with our boat departing soon, we had to power walk to the dock to make it in time. Thankfully, we made it with just a few minutes to spare. The Aussies were on the same boat, and we shared a few laughs before everyone settled in for a quiet ride back. There were three couples including us, and all three women fell asleep on their partner\u0026rsquo;s shoulder for the ride home.\nBack at our hotel, we grabbed some snacks from 7-Eleven and relaxed for a bit. We spent some time planning our trip to Yamanouchi the next day, which would take us about 10 hours on various trains (yikes).\nAs one last hurrah to one of our favourite cities of the trip, we went back to the rooftop bar to use up the rest of our tokens on drinks. It was freezing outside, but we are suckers for an outdoor rooftop dining area, so we drank our drinks on the balcony while wearing a million layers (Aussies love fresh air, ok?).\nWe chatted about how much we loved Hiroshima and how sad we were to leave. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful city full of history, and we felt that we had barely scratched the surface of what it had to offer. We wished we had planned to stay at least an extra night, but that just means that we have to come back on our next trip to Japan!\nEach of us got one last bath in Hiroshima and turned in for the night. We needed a good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep so that we could maximise our brain power for the day ahead.\n","date":"2 2月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cities/hiroshima/","section":"Cities","summary":"","title":"Hiroshima • 広島市","type":"cities"},{"content":" Day 10\nEn route to Ōsaka • 大阪 # We started our day in Kyōto, waking up around 8:00 am. Tristan had a fantastic sleep on the futon, but Soph\u0026rsquo;s sore back made her sleep a little less restful. We were quite rushed in the morning as the checkout time was 10:00 am, an hour earlier than we were used to.\nWe packed up, tidied the place, and had a quick breakfast before we left. Tristan opted for leftover curry for breakfast while Soph had a cream puff. Our host instructed us to leave the kitchen tap running ever so slightly to prevent the pipes from freezing, which was a very foreign concept to us.\nWe then embarked on a 15-minute walk to Sanjō Station (三条駅). Ōsaka (大阪) is super close to Kyōto, so our trip ahead was pretty short and straightforward. Our route was simple: one train for ¥450 that would take us straight to a station in Ōsaka. The journey was about 45 minutes, and despite a slight hiccup thinking we were in the wrong carriage, it was a painless trip.\nOnce we arrived at the station, our GPS decided to sabotage us and wrongfully insisted there was one more stop. Thankfully the conductor quickly set us straight, and we hopped off the train and onto a subway. The transfer was easy, and for a total of ¥600 each (around $6.30 AUD), it was a pretty cheap trip.\nWe checked in to our hotel, the Vessel Inn Namba, only 400 metres from Shinsaibashi Shopping Arcade (心斎橋筋) and close to the train station. We dropped off our bags and headed straight back out to explore Dōtonbori (道頓堀).\nAt the entrance of the shopping area was the Cheese Coin, a popular street food stall that we\u0026rsquo;d seen on TikTok. It was basically a pancake in the shape of a ¥10 coin (that actually costs ¥500) with a big wad of mozzarella in the middle that stretches super long when you bite into it. We didn\u0026rsquo;t purposefully seek it out, but there it was, so we decided to give it a try.\nTristan found it a bit bland and overhyped, but Soph, the queen of bland, loved it. Cake and cheese \u0026ndash; what more could a girl want?\nWe spent the rest of the day exploring nerdy stores, mainly checking out manga, trading cards and retro video games. We found some old Game Boys, including a limited edition Pokémon one, but decided to hold off on any purchases until we had a chance to check out a few other stores across the city. An electronics shop had a ThinkPad on display with its webcam open, so we took a sneaky pic of course.\nWhile we were waiting to cross an intersection, a young Japanese woman gave us a small Pokémon figurine. She didn\u0026rsquo;t explain why, but we think she might have gotten it from a capsule toy machine and didn\u0026rsquo;t want it. It was a very random encounter!\nAfter spending a few hours exploring, we headed back to our hotel room for some downtime. Travelling can be exhausting, and sometimes you just need a few hours of doing nothing to recharge.\nAs the afternoon rolled around, we headed back out to explore the local scene. The hotel had a promise of free drinks in the afternoon, but we soon discovered that it was just a self-serve soft drink machine. Free drinks means something different back in Aus\u0026hellip;\nWhile we were down there, we also discovered that the breakfast bar had some promising options like bagels and toast. Noted!\nSoon after, we headed back out to explore Dōtonbori a little more. It was dusk and the last remnants of the sunset fell beautifully over the city.\nOur next stop was supposed to be an Australian pub we\u0026rsquo;d found online, but alas, it was closed. We were a bit bummed out, especially since the website had promised it would be open. But, as we\u0026rsquo;ve learned (against our will), travel is all about adapting, so we decided to try out a random place that promised cold beer. It turned out to be more of an oyster bar, and while the lime sour and beer were decent, the grilled corn was overpriced. We left in search for a decent dinner.\nLuckily for us, we hit the jackpot! We found OKO (thanks to TikTok!), a vegan/vegetarian Okonomiyaki place and it was absolutely delicious. We arrived a bit early and debated about whether we should wait a few minutes before going in. Soph won that round, and we headed up to find only one person ahead of us in line. The owner, Shiho, runs the entire joint by herself and was super sweet and accommodating. She does everything she can to accommodate dietary requirements and allergies \u0026ndash; we can\u0026rsquo;t recommend this place enough if you are plant-based.\nShe really knows her market -- broke white people. The restaurant was tiny but such a vibe \u0026ndash; Total Drama Island was playing on the TV, and the walls were covered in stickers and drawings. The restaurant can get loud, so there are megaphones at the tables further away that you can use to call her over and order.\nIt\u0026#39;s impossible to have a bad time when the walls are pink. We ordered gyoza and okonomiyaki. Soph loaded her okonomiyaki with potatoes, carrots, asparagus, spinach, and green onions. She also opted for full cheese, which meant her okonomiyaki was smothered in American cheese (as every meal would be if she had her way). Tristan went for the teriyaki chicken okonomiyaki with half cheese. The drinks were a steal at ¥180 each (about $2 AUD), and we filled up on Asahi beer, whiskey highball (whiskey and soda), and a mysterious clear liquid that tasted like a vodka mix. The cool thing about the drinks\u0026rsquo; system was that you could fill it up yourself at the tap \u0026ndash; you just had to yell \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m getting another one!\u0026rsquo; at the owner, and she would say \u0026lsquo;はい!\u0026rsquo; (yes) and it would be added to our bill. A flawless system if you ask us. We demolished/devoured/delighted in our meals and praised the gods of TikTok that recommended this place to us.\nWe left OKO feeling pretty tipsy and full of praise for the owner. It was so cheap for such a filling meal, and we were so grateful to another incredible plant-based restaurant in another city. We had wanted to try okonomiyaki for ages, and we were chuffed to find a place that served both vego and meat options that we could both enjoy.\nOn our way back to the hotel, we stopped by FamilyMart for more drinks and picked up another lemon-scented bubble bar from Lush for our baths. We also got a facial moisturizer for Tristan because, well, he deserves it. We strolled through Dōtonbori, took some pictures, and even stopped by Starbucks to check out some potential gifts for our family and friends.\nTomorrow we\u0026rsquo;re off to Universal Studios!\nDay 11\nUniversal Studios, Japan # Our day started early, around 6:30 AM, with a refreshing hot shower and a quick prep for our much-anticipated visit to Universal Studios.\nWe grabbed some snacks from Lawson and hopped on a train. Despite a small GPS mishap, we eventually made it to Universal Studios. We waited eagerly at the entrance for about 45 minutes before they let us in. We even helped a group of tourists snap a photo in front of the Universal Studios gates. If you\u0026rsquo;re planning on visiting Universal Studios and want to get on a ride before big lines form, it\u0026rsquo;s worth getting to the entrance at least 40 minutes before opening. If you\u0026rsquo;re travelling with JTB, you get to enter 30 minutes earlier than everyone else and enjoy the rides before the crowd pours in. That would be ideal if you want to ride anything before the lines get too long.\nBefore we get into our adventures in the park, here\u0026rsquo;s some advice if you\u0026rsquo;re planning on visiting Universal Studios Japan:\nA note to bigger people: Universal Studios Japan has a lot of rides that are inaccessible for larger people. We didn\u0026rsquo;t know this before we went, and it put a bit of a dampener on the day knowing we couldn\u0026rsquo;t go on every ride we wanted to. Do your research beforehand if you\u0026rsquo;re a size 16 or over, and try out the seat testers at the entrance of the ride before you line up.\nFor reference, Soph is a size 18-20 and the rides that were too small for here were:\nHollywood Dream rollercoaster the Flying Dinosaur Yoshi\u0026rsquo;s Adventure Flight of the Hippogriff (probably \u0026ndash; this is just our guess from seeing the size of the ride carriage). Rides (that we tried) with plenty of room:\nJAWS ride Jurassic Park \u0026ndash; The Ride The Amazing Adventures of Spiderman Mario Kart: Koopa\u0026rsquo;s Challenge Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey (it was a tight fit though). We didn\u0026rsquo;t try any of the rides in the Sesame Street or Minion areas, so do some googling if you intend to visit those areas.\nAnother note: Universal Studios Japan runs on a bit of a weird ticketing system. You can get access to the express lines for certain rides to save time on the day, but you have to select the rides you want in advance. The most popular rides were the Flying Dinosaur and both rides in the Super Nintendo World, so we recommend getting express passes for those rides if you\u0026rsquo;re considering an express pass. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother getting the pass for all rides as the lines for the other rides were pretty short anyway, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re going during an off-peak time of year. Super Nintendo World also has timed entry, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to plan ahead for what time of day you want to visit this area.\nNow back to the day!\nAfter finally getting through the gates, we found The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man ride. It had a really cool set to look at while we were waiting in line, which thankfully wasn\u0026rsquo;t too long. The ride itself had bench seating and comfortably fit both of us, which was a much-needed relief after an embarrassing experience at the Hollywood Dream ride. The ride was a VR experience that made you feel like you were leaping across NYC with Spider-Man, and a bit of adrenaline was just what we needed to boost our spirits.\nWe then ventured into Super Nintendo World, which had super impressive surroundings and props. We tried the Koopa\u0026rsquo;s Challenge ride, basically a game of Mario Kart but VR on a rollercoaster. Thankfully we had express passes for this ride, otherwise we would have had to wait for over an hour as it\u0026rsquo;s super popular. It was fun, but not as good as the Spider-Man ride (controversial opinion, we know). It was a really cool area of the park, but it was absolutely packed, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t hang around too long.\nNext was Harry Potter World, which was surreal to see in person. We were both huge Harry Potter fans growing up, so seeing the trains, Hogsmeade, and the castle brought back so much nostalgia. We also went into Honeydukes and picked up some sweets from the movies.\nWe decided to go on the Forbidden Journey ride, which was another VR ride that took us on a ride through the castle with the characters from the movies. It was such a fun experience \u0026ndash; Soph doesn\u0026rsquo;t love heights, so this was a great way to experience the thrill of a rollercoaster without the fear of falling. The highlight for us was the extremely jarring Japanese voices for all the characters. At the finale of the ride, all of the characters are standing in a line, thanking us for saving the day. Hearing Harry Potter look us dead in the eye and say \u0026ldquo;Arigato gozaimasu\u0026rdquo; (ありがとうございます, thank you in Japanese) was a moment we\u0026rsquo;ll never forget.\nWe were keen to go to Ollivander\u0026rsquo;s wand shop next. We had to wait in line to get in, which we thought was because lots of people wanted to buy a wand. But to our surprise, it was actually a show! We were ushered into a dimly lit room surrounded by shelves filled with wand boxes. The actor, who was playing the role of Ollivander, was speaking in English but also paused to give the Japanese translation after each sentence. He was clearly an extremely talented American actor, and he seemed completely fluent in Japanese! He called up someone from the group to use a few wands to find one that chose her, just like in the movie. Each spell made things move around the room and made the lights flash \u0026ndash; it was a really cool experience to have before entering the actual shop.\nAfter the show, we entered the shop and planned to buy our own wands. We took a quiz on the train ride there that matched our personalities to specific wands. However, after some consideration, we decided not to buy wands at all. They were quite expensive, and we realised it would probably just end up collecting dust on a shelf at home. Soph did try on this cool owl headband though.\n*Steven Fry voice* I think that bird is shagging your head. We finished off our Harry Potter World experience with a couple of butterbeers. They were sweet and refreshing, like a mix of creaming soda and ginger beer with a yummy layer of foam on top. We also watched a live performance by a few Japanese actors, all in different Hogwarts houses pretending to practice using their wands. The show was a bit young for us, but we still enjoyed it.\nNext, we decided to go on the JAWS ride. We rode around on a boat that was being hunted by a shark. There was fire, lots of splashing, and the boat driver even shot at the (fake) shark with a (very fake) shotgun. It was a funny experience going on such an American ride in Japan of all places.\nWe also went on the Jurassic Park ride, which is basically a boat that follows a track through a dinosaur enclosure. A T. Rex escapes, and you have to outrun it on the boat through the flooded visitor\u0026rsquo;s centre. Eventually you escape (after a really close call with the dinosaur) and you go down a steep 26-metre drop and get soaked at the end. The ride was really immersive, and the drop was pretty scary \u0026ndash; Tristan screamed in a way Soph had never heard, and she didn\u0026rsquo;t stop laughing for a good 20 minutes. 10/10.\nWe were also considering going on the scariest ride in the park, the Flying Dinosaur. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty high, and you actually lay down and basically fly around the Jurassic Park area. Soph was really hesitant because of her fear of heights, but the test seat actually saved the day because the seats were too small anyway. The attendant helping us with the test seat was really nice about it \u0026ndash; he said \u0026rsquo;these seats are Japanese size\u0026rsquo; in a joking way. It was really comforting to hear a staff member acknowledge the problem in a light-hearted way. This is probably a common experience of Western people who visit Japan, and it made Soph feel less alone.\nThe park was full of interesting food vendors \u0026ndash; halfway through the day Tristan got some pork ribs. We had an early dinner and decided to get some pizza from the Spider-Man area. We ordered four slices, expecting them to be Australian-sized slices. We didn\u0026rsquo;t realise that these slices had to come as a meal, so we ended up with four individually boxed quarters of an enormous pizza and four drinks. The language barrier didn\u0026rsquo;t help, so we just accepted it and ate our pizza.\nAfter our pizza shop debacle, we decided to wander around a bit more, checking out the last of the shops. But honestly, most of the stuff was pretty gimmicky. The print quality of the shirts was sub-par, and it all felt a bit like a tourist trap. So, we left the park with a magnet, memories, pictures, and bellies full of food we didn\u0026rsquo;t really want. Despite the ups and downs, we were both glad we powered through and stayed for the whole day.\nAfter a long day, we hopped on the train and headed home. During our transfer from the train to the subway, we faced a choice: take the escalator or climb three flights of big steps. We decided to take the stairs. It was tough, but we made it to the top and felt really proud of ourselves. This sign at the station made us laugh:\nWe spent the rest of the day relaxing in our hotel room and prepared for a day of shopping the next day.\nDay 12\nShopping in Ōsaka # We had a bit of a late start, waking up around 9:30 am. It was our shopping day, so we got ready and headed out to Dōtonbori. Soph had to have another cheese coin, of course.\nWe explored Dōtonbori and many of its\u0026hellip;ahem\u0026hellip;interesting stores. It was a gorgeous clear day, so we also got some great pics along the canal.\nWe couldn\u0026rsquo;t go past the enormous Don Quijote store \u0026ndash; it was six stories full of everything you could ever need, and a bunch of stuff that nobody in human history could ever need, like this tote bag:\nSoph found some lipstick, and Tristan managed to snag a hat that actually fit his head. We also picked up some new earrings. Checking out was a bit of a challenge with the long lines and the tax-free confusion, but we managed to save about 10% thanks to our passports. If you go to Japan and accumulate lots of coins you don\u0026rsquo;t need, take them to Don Quijote as they\u0026rsquo;ll exchange them for notes!\nAfter we were done exploring Dōtonbori, we then made our way to Amerika-mura (アメリカ村). The area is a magnet for the cool kids of Japan, with over 2,000 stores selling local and overseas fashion (mainly American).\nWhile we were there, we stumbled upon this adorable sticker shop called B-side Label. They had so many unique designs, and Tristan even found a shirt that he absolutely loved. The lady at the checkout was incredibly sweet and seemed genuinely impressed with our attempts at speaking Japanese. She even gifted us a free sticker as a token of appreciation from the people of Japan. She even gave Tristan a “Nihongo Jouzu” (日本語上手), which means \u0026ldquo;Japanese very good\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s always rewarding to hear that as we spent many hours trying to learn the basics of the language in the lead up to our trip, Tristan especially.\nWe continued our shopping spree, exploring vintage clothing stores and finding a cute, colourful jumper from Paragraph. It was basically Soph\u0026rsquo;s personality in a jumper, so she had to have it. She was stoked that it fit her too!\nAfter all that shopping we were famished, so we hit up McDonald\u0026rsquo;s. Tristan tried the barbecue soy sauce burger with bacon, and Soph stuck to her fries and melon Fanta. We realised too late that we should have just ordered a meal, but hey, you live and you learn!\nWe walked around the city a bit more, taking in the sights and sounds of Ōsaka. Pics or it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen:\nWe decided to call it a day on the shopping front, having spent a bit more than we\u0026rsquo;d planned. Back at the hotel, we chilled out, did some laundry, and Tristan even treated himself to a BathBeer ™.\nFor dinner, we decided to splurge on some Kobe beef at a place we found on TripAdvisor. Kobe beef is a premium kind of wagyu that comes from Kobe, a city close to Ōsaka. Because it\u0026rsquo;s so closeby, most people eat it in Ōsaka as it is very fresh here. It was a grill-your-own-meat kind of place, which was a fun experience. We ordered our meats from an iPad on the wall and enjoyed some mega lemon sours. Soph even tried a piece of Tristan\u0026rsquo;s wagyu steak and admitted it was pretty good!\nAfter indulging, we then spent some time enjoying the city at night. The light-up signs Ōsaka is known for really came to life.\nWe ended the night at The Australian Pub, which was thankfully open on our last night in Ōsaka. We found this place on the internet a few months before our trip because we thought it would be cool to visit an Australian pub in Japan, and the fact that it had a \u0026ldquo;delicious fucking mess\u0026rdquo; on the menu had us sold.\nWe were not disappointed. The owner, Ōsaka Joe, is a super nice guy and spoke excellent English. He lived in Australia for a few years and wanted to either open a Japanese pub in Australia or an Australian pub in Ōsaka. We were glad he chose the latter!\nIt was refreshing to have a full-on conversation in English with someone other than each other. We had lots of drinks, shared some Vegemite cheese toast, and even scored some free buttery nipple shots with some fellow Aussies. Joe really had everything from Aus \u0026ndash; he even had some Panadol and Berocca if you wanted an Aussie hangover cure!\nWhat a fun way to cap off our time in this incredible city. We stumbled back to our hotel around 12:30 am and crashed.\n","date":"30 1月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cities/osaka/","section":"Cities","summary":"","title":"Ōsaka • 大阪","type":"cities"},{"content":" Day 6\nOff to Kyōto # We started our day bright and early in Tōkyō, packing up our stuff in record time \u0026ndash; just about an hour. A quick fit check:\nIt\u0026#39;s giving Garfield. By 8:00 am, we were ready to bid farewell to Shinjuku \u0026ndash; but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t leave without one final visit to our beloved breakfast spot, Doutor. Thankfully it\u0026rsquo;s a franchise so this certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t our last serve of cheese toast, but we were always served by the same guy, and we\u0026rsquo;ll miss starting our day with his excellent service. It felt bittersweet to already be moving on to a new city.\nOur next stop was the Tōkyō Metropolitan Government Building (東京都庁, AKA Tochō), a chilly 20-minute walk away. It was the coldest morning we\u0026rsquo;d experienced in Japan so far, but we braved the chill, eager to take in the view from the (free!) observation deck.\nTochō in all its glory. To our disappointment, our timing was a bit off \u0026ndash; the deck opened at 9:30 am, and we were there half an hour early. With our check-out time looming at 11:00 am, we decided not to wait around. With a tight schedule hanging in the balance, we made the tough call to leave.\nOn our way back to the hotel, we stopped at Shinjuku Station to book our train tickets. It was tricky to figure out (especially while short on time), but after a bit of fumbling around, we finally figured out how to use our JR pass properly and get free tickets (according to girl maths at least). It was a small victory, but after missing our train to Nikkō yesterday, we were thrilled to have a win. With our tickets in hand, we felt accomplished. We were actually doing this!\nThe last of the sunny weather for the next few days. After indulging in a cozy hot chocolate each from a vending machine, we defrosted in our warm hotel room, got our bags together and checked out of the hotel. The process was super easy \u0026ndash; we just had to press a button on a touch screen in the lobby. We made our way to the subway and almost lugged our bags down the stairs, but thanks to two kind Japanese ladies (who didn\u0026rsquo;t speak a word of English), we found the elevator. It took us a moment to get the message, but when we eventually realised we thanked them profusely.\nOnce on the subway, we were lucky enough to snag some seats and enjoyed a ride through the outer suburbs of Tōkyō. Tristan had a bit of a mishap when the train accelerated and his bags, which were on wheels, went flying towards a group of schoolgirls. He had to quickly retrieve them before we had a lawsuit on our hands, and even managed to squeak out an apology in broken Japanese.\nNow at a new station, we were waiting for our first Shinkansen of the trip. We felt like kings living in luxury while waiting in the heated passengers only area \u0026ndash; it had its own small store full of cheap snacks. We stocked up on some onigiri and coffee and settled in. The train was slightly delayed due to snow on the tracks\u0026hellip;this was definitely the first time we were excited to be delayed!\nBefore we knew it, our Shinkansen was about to arrive. With a little help from a kind stranger, we managed to find our way to the correct terminal. Tristan was a champion and lugged both of our suitcases up the stairs.\nLuckily he never skips leg day. We made it to the platform early enough to see our very first Shinkansen roll into the station. It was surreal seeing this marvel of engineering in person.\nBoarding was painless \u0026ndash; we put our luggage in their dedicated compartment at the back of the carriage and enjoyed the legroom of our comfy seats. The train was pretty empty, so it was nice to feel like we weren\u0026rsquo;t getting in anybody\u0026rsquo;s way. We settled in for the ride and were off to Kyōto a few minutes later.\nAbout half an hour into our journey, we caught an unexpected glimpse at the iconic Mt. Fuji (富士山).\nNo words. Mt. Fuji is notoriously hard to spot because it is often blanketed in fog, so our hopes for seeing it, especially on the train, were low. Our surprise only added to our excitement \u0026ndash; the older Japanese businessmen sitting nearby must have rolled their eyes at our shocked gasps and incessant camera clicking.\nLittle did we know that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only time we would be in awe on this train trip \u0026ndash; a short while later the weather darkened and white fields and trees started to appear \u0026ndash; snow!! The forecast was true and we were stoked. The train had to slow down due to the snow, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t mind. It gave us more time to appreciate the beauty of the Japanese countryside blanketed in white.\nOur two-hour train trip had transported us from the bustling city of Tōkyō to the winter wonderland of Kyōto. We basically sprinted out of the station to experience snow falling from the sky for the first time ever. Surreal is an understatement!\nWe navigated through the snow with our luggage, taking care not to slip on the icy patches. It was a bit of a struggle, but luckily our hotel was only a short walk from the station. We made it to our hotel, the Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel, which was right on the esplanade of a beautiful river bank. This was one of the nicer hotels we had booked for our trip, so we were really looking forward to checking in.\nThe hotel was super fancy, and we were excited to try out the onsen, a traditional Japanese hot spring (basically a naturally-occurring hot tub \u0026ndash; sounds like a bad Seth Rogen movie). After settling into our room, we dropped off our bags and made our way back outside to explore the snowy city.\nWe had dinner at a small asian fusion restaurant near the river \u0026ndash; nothing special, but we did get a kick out of our waiter who was a big Radiohead fan (like us). We did some more exploring after dinner and got some cool photos of Kyōto at night.\nWe even found a cool guitar store in a nearby shopping area. Soph got her Dad a capsule toy from one of their toy machines. Good to tick off the first gift of the trip!\nEventually we ended our day by the river, taking in the beauty of the water at night. We were sinking some tinnies too \u0026ndash; you can take the Aussie out of Australia, but you can\u0026rsquo;t take the Australia out of the Aussie. We headed back to hotel to relax (in a big Japanese bath, of course) after a big day of travel and planned to visit the bamboo forest and try out a plant-based gyoza restaurant that Soph found online.\nDay 7\nBamboo Forest and Tenryū-ji # Tristan got an early start and decided to visit the onsen in the hotel. It was a steamy, relaxing experience, despite sharing the bath with a couple of old Japanese dudes. After a refreshing soak, he went for a walk, grabbed a coffee from a vending machine, and did some stretches.\nNot a bad view! Soph, on the other hand, decided to catch up on some much-needed sleep. She was still asleep when Tristan got back to the room. Typical.\nA bit later on, Soph lifted her suitcase and pulled a muscle in her back. She felt a little better after resting for an hour or so, so we ventured out for breakfast. The snowy Kyōto streets were stunning in the morning sun.\nWe found a Melbourne-style café, Common Well, after a 15-minute walk and enjoyed some focaccia with butter and apricot jam, minestrone soup, and a caramel yuzu latte. We were delighted to have something close to the coffee we have back home.\nAfter breakfast, we were keen to make our way to Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (also known as the Bamboo Forest). We decided against biking because of Soph\u0026rsquo;s back and the icy conditions, so we took two subways instead. Thanks to our JR passes, the journey was straightforward, easy, and free.\nWe reached Arashiyama (嵐山) Station and found this gorgeous art installation nearby. It\u0026rsquo;s called the Kimono Forest and is composed of 600 poles covered in kimono fabric. The poles form a trail to Tenryū-ji Temple (天龍寺), which we visited after our first stop.\nPink is definitely his colour. To our delight, on the other side of the station were a number of food vendors serving delicious Japanese food. Soph was beyond excited to find her very first vegetable gyoza of the trip, so we both got a serving of that. It was deep-fried and served with a sweet and sour sauce \u0026ndash; ugh say less!!\nThe bamboo forest was a sight to behold, but the icy conditions made it a bit of a challenge. We had to tread veeeerrry carefully to avoid slipping, and the crowd of tourists didn\u0026rsquo;t help. Regardless, the forest was beautiful. The bamboo trees absolutely tower over you \u0026ndash; it felt like the forest was giving you a hug.\nOur adventure continued with a visit to a sprawling, lush estate that belonged to Ōkōchi Denjirō (大河内 傳次郎, 1898-1962), a Japanese silent movie actor. The estate, Ōkōchi Sansō (大河内山荘), is at the end of the winding forest paths and costs ¥1000, around $10 AUD per person. The cost deterred most tourists, so the snow was mostly untouched, and it felt like we had the place to ourselves.\nThe estate was at the top of the hill too, so the views were incredible.\nWe spent about an hour exploring the estate, taking photos, and even enjoying some tea and biscuits at the tea house.\nWe even met a lovely Aussie from Melbourne on our stroll. He had a couple of professional cameras with him, so we offered to take a photo of him, and he did the same with our camera. We were so grateful \u0026ndash; it turned out to be one of our favourite pictures from the trip.\n\u0026#39;Smile if you love gyoza!\u0026#39; After peeling ourselves away from this slice of paradise, we headed down a different path through the bamboo forest. By now we had worked up an appetite, so luckily we stumbled upon Toriyama Ukichi (とり山卯吉 嵐山店), a fried chicken restaurant with some vego options. Tristan indulged in some fried chicken (of course) and Soph devoured a potato croquette (double of course). Definitely go here for a quick bite to eat if you visit Arashiyama! It\u0026rsquo;s tricky to find on Google so here is its Google Maps page.\nWe were delighted to see some blooming cherry blossoms nearby, which was extra delightful because we were about a month early for cherry blossom season.\nWith Soph\u0026rsquo;s hangriness under control, we walked around Arashiyama in search of somewhere else to explore. There are temples abound here, and we quickly stumbled upon Tenryū-ji (天龍寺), a 678-year-old Japanese Buddhist temple that featured three beautiful buildings and Sōgen-chi Pond (曹源池), which was full of koi. The temple grounds originally contained around 150 sub-temples, but all of them have been destroyed by fire or damaged during battle. Temples in Japan are particularly susceptible to fire, and this temple was most recently rebuilt around 1900. Today, only traces of the original design remain.\nWe took off our shoes to walk inside the main building \u0026ndash; it was surreal walking on the tatami mats and admiring the intricate paintings on the walls, doors, and ceiling. We didn\u0026rsquo;t take many photos inside because we wanted to be respectful.\nThe grounds were covered in a thick layer of snow, and the lake was clear enough to catch glimpses of the koi every now and again. At one point we saw a couple leap out of the water!\nAs the day turned into night, we made our way back to the station and hopped on a tram packed with people. The payment system was confusing, but we managed to figure it out without pissing off too many Japenese people.\nWe stopped at FamilyMart for some snacks and decided to have a chill night after such a long day. Here is Tristan with his second-favourite snack, tuna onigiri.\nHis favourite snack is Sophie, of course. For dinner, we opted for a nearby Italian restaurant. It felt a bit strange eating pizza in Japan, but after the day that we had, we just wanted something that was easy. The restaurant was lovely, and the service was top-notch. We even had some wine, which was very unlike us (Soph usually opts for a G\u0026amp;T, while Tristan is a beer guy through and through). But, when in Rome (in Japan)!\nEven though we were dead tired, that didn\u0026rsquo;t stop us from exploring more of Kyōto late at night (we blame the wine). We crossed the bridge and went to Book Off, Japan\u0026rsquo;s answer to EB Games. Soph found some cool Japanese Batman and Star Wars paraphernalia, while Tristan was glued to the Yu-Gi-Oh and anime sections. He has a Dark Magician shirt from Yu-Gi-Oh, so it was cool to see its actual card. We didn\u0026rsquo;t end up buying anything, but it was cool to see the things we love in Japanese.\nOn our way back to the hotel, we saw a restaurant that served horse meat (and was very proud of it, too). You do you, Japan.\nI beg to differ. We soon headed back to the hotel for our nightly ritual \u0026ndash; snacks, beer, and a bath. What a great day.\nDay 8\nKyōto Aquarium # The morning started with a hearty breakfast at a French café, Café Bistrot Aux Bons Morceaux. Soph was instantly sold on the bread \u0026ndash; waiters roam around with a basket full of different types of bread, and you could have as many as you\u0026rsquo;d like. They even had a type of bread with chunks of cheese baked into it \u0026ndash; if you go here, we definitely recommend getting that one if you love cheese. For the main meals, Tristan had a smoked sausage with two fried eggs, a side salad (which he didn\u0026rsquo;t touch, because, well, why would he?), and a couple of potatoes. Soph indulged in a delicious French onion soup, which was cheesy, hearty, and delicious. We also enjoyed a juice and a hot coffee, which they kept refilling.\nAs we were leaving, we had a bit of an odd encounter with a pair of women who seemed to find us amusing for some reason. We didn\u0026rsquo;t stick around to find out why. Instead, we quickly paid and left, only to be stopped by a knock on the window. Turns out, Soph left her scarf behind. Oops!\nAfter our delicious carby breakfast, we hopped on the subway to visit the Kyōto Aquarium (京都水族館). The journey was a bit of a trek, especially with the snow, but it was worth it.\nAfter a quick journey on the subway, we arrived at the aquarium. We had a bit of a hiccup upon arrival because we booked tickets for the wrong day, but with the help of Google Translate\u0026rsquo;s audio feature, they arranged a refund, and we purchased new tickets. They were so helpful and understanding despite the language barrier.\nAfter getting the ticket fiasco sorted, we were in. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take Soph long to find another animal to make her entire personality \u0026ndash; the Chinese Giant Salamander. One of the largest amphibians in the world, they\u0026rsquo;re native to China and were introduced to the Kyōto Prefecture in the 1950s. Sadly, they\u0026rsquo;re critically endangered, so it was cool to read about the Aquarium\u0026rsquo;s conservation efforts. Soph fell in love with them because they pile on top of each other like a little rugby team. The picture on the left is a Japanese Giant Salamander, and the dog pile on the right is all Chinese Giant Salamanders.\nNext we moved on to the seals. The tank housed both fur seals and earless seals, but the earless seals were sleeping, so they were out of the action. The fur seals were so active, always jumping in and out of the water to pose for photos, zoom underwater and steal a fish from the handlers. We could\u0026rsquo;ve watched them for hours.\nThe penguin area was next. We were delighted to see little cape penguins waddling around \u0026ndash; they\u0026rsquo;re native to South Africa, so they\u0026rsquo;re comfortable in Kyōto\u0026rsquo;s warm summers and cold winters. They all had their own names, like Taco (たこ), and we saw this hilarious map of the penguins\u0026rsquo; relationships (the penguins, their children, and the handlers they love/hate). Tristan even had a staring contest with one of them (the penguin won, of course).\nWe then came indoors to the Sea of Kyōto section, which houses around fifty species of fish, stingrays, and Japanese pilchards (small fish that move in unison in a large school) in their 500 ton tank. The tank is 9 metres deep and 22 metres wide, so it was pretty impressive. When we were in the early stages of planning our trip this was one of the first attractions on our list, so it was really cool to finally see it in person.\nNext up was the jellyfish section \u0026ndash; wow is an understatement. We had never seen some of these species before, and it was mesmerising to see them up close. They even had a display showing the growth stages of jellyfish from day one to two months, which was really cool to see.\nMoving on from the little floaty guys, we reached the last section of the aquarium \u0026ndash; the Finding Nemo Cast and Others section (that\u0026rsquo;s what we assume it\u0026rsquo;s called anyway). So cool to see clownfish in person as well as the other cool species that had on display. They also had some amazing jellyfish pendants hanging from the ceiling!\nWe made our way home after finding a cool little café that was housed in an old train carriage. Tristan had a hot dog and Soph devoured a cinnamon pretzel.\nWe stopped off at our hotel room to squeeze in a quick nap before heading off to explore the smaller lane ways nearby. They were full of small, family-owned restaurants that were a delight for the senses (smell and sight in particular).\nFor dinner, we took a chance on an inviting basement restaurant. They use an app that customers have on their phone to take orders, but we needed a Japanese phone number to do that. Because we were relying on Wi-Fi only to avoid roaming fees, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option. The waiter eventually just gave us his phone to order, which is when we discovered this was yet another restaurant that didn\u0026rsquo;t have a ton of great vegetarian options. The waiter was really helpful (with the assistance of Google Translate, again) and Soph enjoyed some grilled veges.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t super filling, so we decided to try another place. This time, we researched vegetarian options on Google and found a decent-looking gyoza place, ChaoChao Gyoza in Shijo-Kawaramachi (四条河原町). We eventually found it and knew it would be delicious because it was packed with only white people (being plant based is white people behaviour, of course). We had to wait for a short while because it was super popular \u0026ndash; luckily we were able to wait inside, safe from the cold.\nThis place was incredible. The kitchen is out in the open, so you can chat with the staff while they work. They were so funny and knew enough English to have a decent conversation \u0026ndash; it was so nice to have a conversation with someone other than each other. They had a set menu that was a sight for sore eyes:\nAs soon as we saw the Fried Cheese we knew we were home. Every single bite of the gyoza was a trip to heaven. We each had a set menu, and we had every kind of gyoza covered between us. Because Tristan wasn\u0026rsquo;t as hungry, Soph got to try all the gyoza. Between that, the friendly staff and the general fun vibe of the restaurant, this was a real highlight of the trip.\nThis spread lasted not even five minutes. Tristan ordered a Red Eye, which is made of beer and tomato juice. It sounds weird because it is \u0026ndash; the confused look on the waitress\u0026rsquo;s face when he ordered it was priceless. He ordered it because it was recommended by someone on a podcast he listens to. Tristan took one sip and immediately regretted his choice (boys, amirite?).\nWe also ordered warm sake, something we had both wanted to try the entire trip, and thankfully it was much tastier than the Red Eye. The waitress asked us if we knew what \u0026lsquo;Kampai\u0026rsquo; (乾杯, cheers in English) meant, and we proudly responded, \u0026lsquo;Of course we know Kampai!\u0026rsquo;. We clinked our glasses together and took a sip. It was strong, almost like wine, but tasty nonetheless.\nWe were reluctant to leave because it was so much fun drinking, eating, and chatting to the staff, but luckily for us the good times didn\u0026rsquo;t stop once we left. We walked out and it was snowing so heavily! It was so thick and powdery \u0026ndash; after the experience we just had, we felt like we were in a movie.\nWe decided to head back to our hotel and visit the onsen. As bath lovers, we were keen to give it a go. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t go together as men and women bathe separately, rightfully so.\nYou need to be fully naked and shower before and after the bath to keep it clean. We were a bit nervous at first, but once you get over the initial shock of being naked in front of strangers, it\u0026rsquo;s a really relaxing experience. The water is heated by the natural hot springs in the area, and in our hotel there was a bath both inside and outside. We both opted for the outside bath as the cold winter air was a nice contrast to the hot water. We both really enjoyed it and would definitely do it again.\nAfter regrouping outside the bathing area, we headed back to our room. The night was a much-needed win after many lacklustre vegetarian meals. Japanese people are known for their incredible cuisine, not for their incredible plant-based cuisine. It felt reassuring to finally find a place that enthusiastically served food that fit Soph\u0026rsquo;s dietary needs. We were so full and relaxed that we fell asleep almost instantly.\nDay 9\nA much-needed quiet day # The next morning, we woke up early and headed out for breakfast. We initially wanted to go to a place called Smart Coffee for some pancakes, but there was a long wait, so we headed to our fave breakfast franchise \u0026ndash; you already know which one. It snowed overnight, so the mountain near our hotel was perfectly dusted in white.\nAfter the craziness of the days prior, we decided to have a more chill day just exploring the city. We headed to the Kyōto National Garden, which was a beautiful sight with all the snow melting in the warm sun.\nWe stumbled upon the Kyōto Imperial Palace inside the gardens and decided to explore it. It was a quiet, serene experience, with only a few people around. We strolled around the gardens, admiring the buildings where emperors once met with important people.\nFun fact: Kyōto (which literally means capital city) was the capital of Japan from 794 - 1868, until the Emperor\u0026rsquo;s residence was moved to Tōkyō during the Meiji restoration, which automatically made it the new capital of Japan. It has been destroyed by fire and been rebuilt eight times \u0026ndash; the current version was built in 1855.\nThe palace comprises a number of small buildings. One of our favourites was the Shishinden (紫宸殿), which was used for enthronements of new Emperors.\nWe also loved the Kogosho (小御所) building, which was used as a ceremonial hall and a place for the Emperor to meet with military leaders.\nWe learned about the fascinating games the nobles used to play, like Kyokusui-no-en (曲水の宴) \u0026ndash; played at the beginning of March, they floated a sake cup down the pond in the Oikeniwa Garden and coming up with an improvised poem before it floated past them.\nAnother game they played was Kemari (蹴鞠), an ancient Japanese game played by courtiers where they aimed to keep a ball off the ground for as long as possible. We loved learning about these games because even though we think of them as these stoic, serious people, they were in many ways just like us. They enjoyed the frivolity of royalty and power, but sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s nothing better than kicking a ball around with your mates.\nThe grounds were yet another example of a surprisingly serene park despite being smack bang in the middle of a city. Japan is so dedicated to preserving as much of its history as it can, especially when it comes to buildings of cultural significance. Thanks to the hard work of many generations of historians, we were able to step back in time and see Japan as it was hundreds of years ago. It was a really special experience.\nOn our walk back through the park, we tuned in to Triple J\u0026rsquo;s Hottest 100 countdown (basically an Aussie public holiday at this point). It was a great soundtrack for our walk to lunch and Soph in particular enjoyed finding out who made the list. The walk took the better part of an hour, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t mind as our route was flat, cool, and full of interesting architecture unique to Kyōto.\nWe eventually arrived at our spot for lunch \u0026ndash; the incredible gyoza place we ate at the night before, ChaoChao Gyoza in Shijo-Kawaramachi. It was so delicious that we had to come back one more time. The staff remembered us, which was surprising given that we look identical to the hundreds of white tourists they serve per day.\nAfter devouring yet another set menu, we returned to our hotel to check out and move on to our new lodging, The Machiya Villa Sanjo Shirakawa Koji. It\u0026rsquo;s a traditional Japanese home that has two stories, a kitchen, a traditional dining table (sitting on the floor), a bedroom with tatami mats and a futon, and an enormous bath (we like baths, ok?). We were excited to get a taste of how Japanese people actually live.\nAfter checking out, we decided to walk because it was only 15 minutes away by foot. It was a bit of a trek, especially with our heavy luggage struggling to navigate the icy, slushy pavement. It was a slog, but the thought of a nice, warm bath at the end of the day kept us going.\nOnce we arrived we were more than ready to settle in and relax, but to our dismay, we realised that we had to check in at a different location about a 10-minute drive away. This was frustrating, especially for Soph after a big day of walking, so Tristan (like the selfless legend he is) jumped in a taxi by himself to sort it out while Soph waited at the house with the luggage. This was the only time on the trip we used a taxi as they\u0026rsquo;re quite expensive in Japan, but it was worth it to get the check-in sorted as quickly as possible. A good excuse to experience it!\nTristan sorted it out in record time and gave Soph a code to enter the accommodation while he made his way back. Thankfully, the house did not disappoint! It was such a beautiful place that it was totally worth the struggle, but we vowed to double-check the check-in requirements for the rest of the trip.\nAfter the long, tiring day that was, we decided to take it easy and just have snacks for dinner. Soph headed out to Lawson to stock up. It was her first time venturing out on her own in Japan, which was especially milestone-y because she managed to purchase everything despite her dodgy Japanese. After she returned home with snacks in hand, we parked ourselves in the living room and watched some Japanese TV. It was some kind of competition show that involved pranks and really weird haircuts.\nWe each capped off the night with a long, steamy soak in the big bathtub. This bath was our favourite of all the baths we had experienced so far in Japan \u0026ndash; it was in a relatively modern bathroom and was easily 50% bigger than a regular bath. It was just what our tired feet needed.\nOne of the reasons we picked this place was because we wanted to experience a good nights\u0026rsquo; sleep on a traditional futon. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know, Japanese people traditionally sleep on a tatami mat floor with a thin mattress and a few sheets. Everything is easily foldable, so you\u0026rsquo;re able to pack it away and make more room in the home during the day.\nThe home also had a western style bed, which we were forced to use the first night because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have the right sheets for the futon. We were keen to have the Futon Experience ™, so we messaged our host who promised to drop off the sheets the next day.\nDay 10\nExploring Philosopher\u0026rsquo;s Path on Two Wheels # The next morning, we decided to rent bikes and head to Philosopher\u0026rsquo;s Path (哲学の道). We used PiPPa, which is a bike rental app that has bikes all over the area that you can rent for a daily flat rate. The app was a bit tricky to use at first, but eventually we figured it out. We thought they were e-bikes (good for hills and our lack of cardiovascular fitness), but they were actually just regular push bikes (and heavy ones too!). If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother you, we would recommend PiPPa! If you\u0026rsquo;re athletically-challenged like us, we would recommend hiring e-bikes instead to navigate the hilly parts of Kyōto.\nSquint if you love rainbow beanies! We noodled around for a bit and stopped at FamilyMart to grab some snacks for breakfast. Energy jellies were our favourite \u0026ndash; so easy to eat on the go, and they gave us a decent energy boost. We also grabbed some of our regular snacks.\nA cream bun a day keeps the sadness away. We rode around the streets of Kyōto for another 20 minutes or so until we finally made it to Philosopher\u0026rsquo;s Path. We had just ridden up a steep hill and planned to park our bikes there, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear whether we had to park the bikes at a PiPPa drop off zone or not. After some back and forth, we decided to ride them back downhill to a drop-off zone just to be safe and then walked back up the hill to explore the path on foot.\nPhilosopher\u0026rsquo;s Path gets its name from the famous Japanese philosophers, Nishida Kitaro (西田幾多郎) and Hajime Tanabe (田辺 元), who used to walk this path on their way to Kyōto University. The whole path takes about 30 minutes to walk in its entirety, but we walked about half of it before we got sidetracked by an uphill road with street vendors and the Ginkakuji (銀閣寺) Temple.\nWe decided to explore the temple first and then come back down to the street vendors afterwards. Originally built in 1482, the temple was intended to be a retirement villa for the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa (足利 義政). After his death, it was converted into a Zen temple. Only two buildings on the grounds have survived various fires and earthquakes, the Silver Pavillion and the Togudo. The grounds are also home to a moss garden, a dry sand garden and a lookout that has an incredible view of Kyōto.\nTemples are a great way to fill in the day with some culture if you don\u0026rsquo;t have much planned \u0026ndash; they are everywhere and always provide a break from the hustle and bustle.\nAfter stopping ourselves from buying everything in the gift shop, we made our way back down the road. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the allure of a potato tornado (spiralled fried potato on a stick) and candied strawberries from a street vendor \u0026ndash; both were delicious and topped up our energy. When we returned to Philosopher\u0026rsquo;s Path, we found something you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to find in Japan \u0026ndash; a restaurant that specialised in Philly Cheesesteaks. Despite being literally on the other side of the planet from Philadelphia, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist and went in. Soph was hoping to try the macaroni and french fries sandwich, but it turned out the macaroni salad had tuna in it, so she settled for the hot chips on their own. Tristan, on the other hand, went for a Philly cheesesteak which was beyond delicious. Our waitress spoke excellent English, which is a rarity in Japan, and a relief when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to order vegetarian food.\nAs we left the restaurant, we spotted a man with two beautiful dogs. They were a deep mahogany colour, and they were so striking that even Tristan (a cat person through and through) commented on their beauty. Soph is pretty knowledgable about dog breeds, but even she didn\u0026rsquo;t know what they were. 22/3/24 Edit: They were Irish Setters! Soph saw a TikTok about them and immediately made the connection. Mystery solved!\nThe path truly is such a serene place, and we made sure to stop and appreciate its beauty. The path is especially popular during cherry blossom season as the canal is lined with them, but even though we were visiting during the off-season, it was still a beautiful sight. Definitely a bucket list moment for us!\nAfter soaking in as much of the path as we could, we decided to head back to our bikes to explore more of the city. We decided to take a more scenic route by the river, which was bumpy but totally worth it for the views. The sunny day reflected so perfectly off the Kyōto River. On our way we were lucky to find a proper downhill road, which was chock-a-block with tiny residential houses and shops. Not to sound too Gen Z, but Japanese surburbia is one of our favourite vibes, and it was so surreal to see it in person.\nWe came across a canal that had stepping stones across it, so we decided to park our bikes and cross the canal for fun. It was a bit of a challenge for Soph, having to jump from one stone to another with her short woman legs, while Tristan with his long man legs only had to step normally to get across the gaps.\nAs we rode back to drop off our bikes, we were perplexed by many groups of people all dressed in matching outfits which were unique to each group. We eventually figured that they might be auditioning for a J-pop idol dance troupe at a nearby theatre. We liked that theory and decided to stick with it.\nAfter a brief stop for snacks, we rode through a massive red Japanese traditional gate that towered over the road beneath. It was like a physical finish line as our drop-off point for our bikes was close by. It was such a nice way to get around the city \u0026ndash; we highly recommend renting bikes if you\u0026rsquo;re heading to Kyōto.\nFinally back at our accom, we decided to put the kitchen to good use and make Japanese curry (Tristan\u0026rsquo;s favourite). We tried to get the ingredients from Lawson, but as it didn\u0026rsquo;t have everything we needed, Tristan ended up getting the rest of the ingredients from Fresco, a Japanese grocery store. The lack of english signage was a challenge, but Tristan managed to get everything he needed with the help of Google Translate.\nAfter schlepping the ingredients back home, we then cooked up a storm. Despite being a little under-seasoned, the curry actually turned out pretty good! It was also really fun to use a Japanese rice cooker, even if the buttons were all in Japanese.\nAfter dinner, we finally made up our futon. The sheets didn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit the mattress, but we made do, and we were glad we made the effort. It was really spacious and comfortable, and it felt like we were having a sleepover.\nOnto Ōsaka tomorrow!\n","date":"25 1月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cities/kyoto/","section":"Cities","summary":"","title":"Kyōto • 京都","type":"cities"},{"content":" Day 1\nThe departure and our first night in Tōkyō # After waiting for what seemed like forever, the day had finally arrived \u0026ndash; we were off to Japan! Our bags were packed, the countdown on the fridge was finally down to zero, and it was time to say goodbye to our orange dude for a few weeks.\nWe arrived at the Gold Coast Airport bright and early at 7:00 a.m (thanks for driving us, Corey!). The check-in process was a breeze thanks to a helpful Jetstar employee (rare we know), and we flew through security with no issues. Heads up if you’re travelling from the international terminal at the Gold Coast Airport – the breakfast options are so mid. They don’t even have a Maccas! We made up for our disappointment by amusing ourselves with some sketching. We had a good laugh as we tried to draw celebrities from memory: try and guess who this is (let’s just say, we won’t be quitting our day jobs anytime soon)!\nBefore we knew it were on board and ready for takeoff. We were a bit miffed to discover that all the in-flight entertainment came with a price tag (thanks Jetstar!). Thankfully our excitement was so high that not even the abysmal free options could bring us down.\nI am not surprised that this only has one season. We said our last goodbyes to Australian soil and off we went! If you\u0026rsquo;re flying internationally, defo bring your own wired headphones and pay for the entertainment package. You want your flight there to go as fast as possible and it will go by so much slower without the first two seasons of The Walking Dead. We spent our long ass flight reading books, playing Animal Crossing and drawing on Tristan\u0026rsquo;s iPad.\nEventually we made it to Japanese airspace and our boredom was finally worth it when we got our first glimpse of the Japanese skyline at nighttime. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it \u0026ndash; we were in Japan!\nDamn, Japan. After one failed landing attempt, we finally touched down at Narita Airport. After such a boring flight, it was such a relief to finally be on the ground and stretch our legs. Tristan did a great job making sure we had all of the paperwork we needed, so much so that we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to fill in the quarantine declaration form on arrival (we felt so cool being some of the few people flashing our blue stickers to the airport staff). We were also in the first group off the plane so we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to wait in the customs line for very long. The customs process itself was pretty straight forward \u0026ndash; we handed over our documents, posed for a picture or two, performed the Rasputin dance, and we were on our way.\nOnce we got through customs, we were stoked to see our bags already on the carousel. With the help of a friendly airport worker (who seemed absolutely delighted to hear our first stop in Japan was ABC Mart), we picked up our Pocket Wi-Fi and let our families know we made it to Japan safely. With our bags and internet secured, our next task was to find a train to Shinjuku Station. The ticketing system was a bit of a learning curve (and an exponential one at that), but thanks to yet another delightful airport worker, we made it on the correct train in one piece.\nGetting the first eyes-closed photo out of the way early. The hour-long train journey was a welcome breather for both of us. We had so many things to do before leaving the airport, and on top of the looming check-in cutoff time at our hotel, the language barrier, and the fact that we had just endured a long flight, we were both feeling a bit overwhelmed. We took comfort in the fact that now that we were on the train, most of the stressful work was done.\nEventually we arrived in Shinjuku (新宿), and the sight of the city at night was an instant cure for our exhaustion. The streets were alive with lights, and the small, hole-in-the-wall restaurants and bars near our hotel were buzzing with happy people enjoying their Friday night.\nWe were so energised by the spirit of the city that our exhaustion immediately dissipated and was replaced by a hunger to explore and a hunger for carbs. We checked in to our hotel, Tokyu Stay Shinjuku, which was thankfully a quick and easy process.\nWe dropped off our bags and immediately went back out to explore. English menus were hard to come by, and to our surprise, vegetarian food was practically non-existent. We were keen to finally try some authentic Japanese-style food, but because we didn\u0026rsquo;t research plant-based restuarants ahead of time, we had to settle for Italian food as many of their staples are vego. Despite this small disappointment, we sat outside (despite it being absolutely freezing) and enjoyed the atmosphere of the city. We fell in love with this particular area of Shinjuku \u0026ndash; our hotel was right in the middle of a dense restaurant area, with most being tiny Izakayas that made you feel like you were in the heart of Japan.\nWe ended the night with a visit to FamilyMart, and there Soph\u0026rsquo;s love affair with cream puffs kicked off with a delicious bang. We enjoyed a strong zero (an alcoholic premix that\u0026rsquo;s famous for it\u0026rsquo;s strong lemon flavour) outside the store. It\u0026rsquo;s considered rude to eat or drink while walking in Japan, so you\u0026rsquo;ll often see people doing so outside of convenience stores instead.\nBack at the hotel, we discovered the joy of Japanese baths. They\u0026rsquo;re deep and fill up quickly, providing a perfect end to a long day. We fell asleep almost instantly, ready for the next day\u0026rsquo;s adventures.\nDay 2\nOur First Full Day in Tōkyō # We woke up excited to finally experience Japan in the daytime. The cold weather was a bit of a shock to the system, especially as Queenslanders, and we quickly learned that you won\u0026rsquo;t get very far without gloves (which we had forgotten to pack). Thankfully the nearest 7Eleven sold them, and with our hands now toasty warm, we walked to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (新宿御苑). Even though many of the plants were out of season, the park was beautiful, and we even found some early-blooming cherry blossoms.\nOn our walk through the park we discovered a greenhouse, which definitely lived up to the \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; part of its name. It housed many species of tropical plants, all thriving in the humidity. It was a warm reprieve from the cold, dry air outside.\nWe spent the rest of the day adjusting to our surroundings and trying new snacks at the various convenience stores. We explored Shinjuku at night, and Soph spotted a hilarious jumper at a H\u0026amp;M which glorifies an Adelaide sporting team (which probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist).\nTristan ended the day with a BathBeer ™, his new favourite way to unwind after a long day on his feet.\nKanpai! • かんぱい！ Day 3\nThe Quest for a Cream Puff # By this point we were really enjoying starting our days in the cold streets of Shinjuku (as opposed to the deathly hot suburbs of Brisbane at this time of year). We took some time to take some pictures around the neighbourhood \u0026ndash; it has a much different vibe in the morning after all the izakayas have closed up shop for the night.\nWe then headed to a local cafe chain called Dotour Coffee Shop. We indulged in the thickest, fluffiest cheese toast you could ever imagine. Tristan tried matcha for the first time and loved it, while Soph enjoyed her apple juice. Little did we know that this was the beginning of an obsession with Doutour.\nOur next stop was Shibuya (渋谷), but we got a bit lost trying to find the train station. It was hidden in a weird spot underground, but we eventually found it and hopped on a train to Yoyogi Park (代々木公園). This was our first experience riding the wonder that is the Tōkyō subway!\nThe park was a bit muddy and less maintained than the one we visited the day before, but it was still bustling with people and dogs. We spent a good twenty minutes dog-watching, spotting breeds from huskies to poodles to spaniels. One particular dog caught our attention\u0026ndash;a big fluffy dog in a purple onesie, with its fur sticking out from the feet and head. It seemed that Japanese people consider dog outfits an art form, and we were here for it.\nAfter the dog park we visited the Meiji Shrine, a massive park area in Tōkyō (東京) that honors the legacy of Emperor Meiji, who is credited for introducing a series of changes which catapulted Japan to the modern world stage. The shrine was huge and had a spiritual vibe to it. We didn\u0026rsquo;t to participate in the rituals because we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to appear insensitive, but we felt privileged to witness such a deep cultural experience.\nWe also tried Dango, a skewer of rice dumplings glazed in a sweet soy sauce. It was deliciously puffy and sticky, but as was becoming a common theme in Japan, we had to hunt down a bin to dispose of the skewer.\nOur next stop was Shibuya, where we planned to visit a perfume factory called The Flavor Design. However, we didn\u0026rsquo;t realize we needed a reservation, so we booked a slot for the next day. We decided to explore Shibuya instead and stumbled upon the Shibuya Hikarie building (渋谷ヒカリエ) in the Shibuya train station. The Sky Lobby 11th floor is a great spot to enjoy the city views, and it\u0026rsquo;s free entry! It\u0026rsquo;s a bit tricky to find, but here\u0026rsquo;s a handy guide on how to get inside.\nThe view of the city and the Shibuya Scramble from the twelfth floor was breathtaking, and we spent a good ten minutes soaking it in.\nWe then decided to visit the Cream Puff Factory in Shimokitazawa (下北沢). The journey there was a bit confusing, but we eventually made it. There were a few people ahead of us on the wait list, so after a quick conversation with the attendant in broken Japanese, we managed to book our spot for two hours later. With time to kill, we decided to explore the neighbourhood. Known for its op shops, relaxed vibe and eclectic art scene, it was delightfully quiet despite being so close to the city and seemed like a lovely place to live.\nWe stumbled upon a Chinese new year market in a residential area, which housed a variety of stalls selling everything from food to clothes to plants. Feeling peckish, we enjoyed our first vegan gyoza of the trip, which was absolutely delightful.\nWe pottered around for another hour before returning to the Cream Puff Factory and we, to our surprise, were given our own private room. The Totoro cream puff we shared was absolutely delicious, filled with the most delightful strawberry cream (as indicated via the pink sakura adorning his left ear \u0026ndash; each unique flavour had its own accessory). It was a popular spot, with everyone taking selfies with their cream puffs (including us, hehe):\nAfter our cream puff factory adventure, we hopped back on the train and headed to Akihabara (秋葉原), known for its electronics, ramen, themed cafes, and anime/manga paraphernalia. We found Super Potato, an electronics store, where Tristan tried to find a Game Boy, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any. Despite this, we had a blast exploring the store\u0026rsquo;s retro games and navigating its steep stairs (we\u0026rsquo;re fit gods after all, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t need the elevator).\nAfter getting our vintage tech fix, we found Kyushu Jangara Ramen, a ramen restaurant that offered vegan options (mmm talk dirty to me). The vegan ramen with soy sauce broth was so delicious that Soph couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop raving about it. Tristan had the tonkotsu ramen, which was basically the epitome of every single flavour he loves (MSG is bae). While we were waiting in line to order, the server immediately figured out that wanted the plant-based option (our whiteness gave us away). Now that\u0026rsquo;s customer service!\nAfter our ramen feast, we did some more electronic shopping. We scored an SD card on sale and an SD card adapter for Soph\u0026rsquo;s MacBook which made it easier for us to save photos from her camera. We then did a few more laps of Akihabara, taking in all the stores and even trying our luck with some capsule toys. Soph got a Tamagotchi one while Tristan got a Pokémon one. They weren\u0026rsquo;t exactly what we\u0026rsquo;d hoped for, but it was fun nonetheless. We even managed to score a Spirited Away coffee mug from a Final Fantasy store nearby.\nWe also came across a camera store filled with vintage cameras. Intrigued, we tried to figure out if it was closed or open. It looked closed, but the door was open, and the lights were on. Suddenly, a Japanese man appeared, pushing a trolley and repeating the English words \u0026ldquo;nine to five only!\u0026rdquo;. It gave us a good laugh that this random Japanese man knew exactly what we were thinking.\nWe continued our exploration, spotting an adorable fluffy cat in a cat cafe window. After a few more laps, we hopped on the train back to the hotel. On our way we saw some guys playing football in the middle of the night in an empty carpark. Pop off, queens.\nWe ended our day by getting lost in Shinjuku station, which was a maze of signs and platforms. We eventually found our way out, only to be charged for walking through the station. We laughed it off and headed back to our hotel, stopping at FamilyMart for some snacks. Soph tried a crepe, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the cream puff. We also enjoyed some drinks outside the FamilyMart, like the true degenerates we are, where we had a good laugh over our \u0026ldquo;Nemon\u0026rdquo; joke. It all started when Tristan misread \u0026ldquo;lemon\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;nemon\u0026rdquo; on a TikTok video. We had been spotting lemons everywhere since that moment (we even saw a lemon bubble bar at Lush which we obviously had to buy).\nDespite walking almost twenty kilometers and getting a bit of chafe on our legs, it was such a fulfilling day. We capped off our day with a relaxing bath and headed to bed.\nDay 4\nThe Perfume Factory # The next day, we woke up a bit later and started off with our favourite cheese toast. Pics or it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen:\nOur main mission for the day was to get our Studio Ghibli Museum tickets. We headed to Lawson\u0026rsquo;s, where they have a machine for ticket purchases. We may have bent the rules a bit by pretending to be Japanese residents, but hey, we heard it worked for others, so why not give it a shot? If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing the same, here\u0026rsquo;s the guide we followed.\nThe ticket machine process was tricky to operate as English speakers, but we made it work. We brought our slip to the counter to finalise the purchase, but poor Tristan had to sign his name in katakana to seal the deal. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say his Japanese writing skills needed a bit of work\u0026hellip;they were so rusty that the attendant had to give him a mini lesson on how to write it correctly. Luckily he didn\u0026rsquo;t mind, and we secured the tickets with ease.\nWe quickly realised that we needed a bigger bag to carry around on our adventures. Thankfully there was a Lululemon store was nearby (Soph\u0026rsquo;s favourite activewear brand), and they had the perfect bag. We opted to take the day to think on it before making a purchase because it was a bit pricey. The store attendant was super nice and strongly suggested we visit Mount Fuji (富士山), which we considered adding to our itinerary just because of his charisma. We vowed to return to the store later in the day, and he wished us well and looked forward to seeing us again.\nAfter that, we caught a train to Shibuya for our perfume-making appointment at The Flavor Design. We arrived early, so we spent some time exploring the area, including the massive Google building. We also tried to find the famous Hachikō statue but had no luck. We even found a cool arcade, but ran out of time to properly check it out.\nFinally, it was time for our perfume-making session. We each chose three base scents and worked with a specialist to create our own unique perfumes, customising the fragrance colour, bottle colour and cap colour. The process was so much fun \u0026ndash; even Tristan, who was initially skeptical of this part of the trip, had a blast!\nWe ended up with two beautiful bottles of perfume that capture exactly what we were going for. Tristan aimed to emulate the smell of a rainforest, while Soph\u0026rsquo;s was to capture a sweeter-yet-elegant aroma. The women at the perfume place were so kind, and even complimented Soph\u0026rsquo;s blue eyes and beanie. We had some small conversations in Japanese \u0026ndash; they asked where we were from and Soph said \u0026ldquo;オーストラリア\u0026rdquo; (Ōsutoraria, Australia in Japanese), and they were all very delighted despite Soph\u0026rsquo;s probably atrocious pitch accent. Tristan also scored a \u0026ldquo;日本語上手\u0026rdquo; (Nihongo Jouzu, Japanese very good in Japanese), which is high praise considering he\u0026rsquo;d only been learning for a few months.\nAfter securing our perfumes, we walked around Harajuku (原宿), grabbed some takoyaki (octopus balls), and bought some Japanese hard candy. We also explored Cat Street, which is known for its trendy fashion boutiques. They were a bit out of our price range (and size range lol), but it was still fun to explore.\nAfter a long day, we found ourselves getting a bit peckish from all the walking. Luckily, we stumbled upon Coco Curry, a popular curry franchise. We were thrilled to discover that this particular branch offered a vegetarian curry sauce, which apparently is only available in about ten of their branches. The vegetarian curry was absolutely delicious and so filling that we felt like we needed a nap right after! Tristan opted for the chicken curry, which was equally yummy. We also couldn\u0026rsquo;t get enough of their water \u0026ndash; it was just really good, we can\u0026rsquo;t explain it.\nWe initially planned to catch a train back to Shinjuku, but ended up walking all the way back (just more proof that we are fit gods). The walk was surprisingly pleasant, taking us across a beautiful bridge and park. We passed by a few software company office buildings overlooking the park, which seemed like a really nice place to work. The weather was perfect for a walk \u0026ndash; cloudy and cool.\nOn our way back we stopped by Sekaido Shinjuku, a stationery shop that was filled with everything you could ever want if you\u0026rsquo;re into stationery. We picked up a few stickers for ourselves and some for Soph\u0026rsquo;s mum who loves scrapbooking.\nWe then fulfilled our promise and returned to Lululemon, where we secured the bag we wanted earlier that day. We were relieved to find it still there and just as perfect as we remembered. Thanks to some tax legislation, we managed to save 10% on the bag by showing our passports. We also caught up with the friendly staff member from earlier, who immediately recognised us and seemed equally excited to see us again. He even gave Soph a pat on the back as we were leaving, which is quite unusual for Japanese people. We were so impressed with their service that we left a five-star Google review.\nAfter a bit of rest at the hotel, we decided to grab dinner at a local shop right outside. The shop boasted no limit to their deep-fried vegetable options on skewers, including deep-fried cheese! We ordered a variety of items, including potato, onion, asparagus, cheese, rice cake with cheese, deep-fried tofu, and french fries. The food was delicious, with the cheese being the star of the show.\nAfter dinner, we stopped by FamilyMart for some dessert (of course). Soph got a soft serve ice cream (they looked so good in the freezer, don\u0026rsquo;t judge), while Tristan opted for a beer. We enjoyed our treats outside, listening to the chatter of a group of people nearby. It was a nice way to wind down after a long day.\nAfter returning to our hotel, we checked the weather for our next city and were surprised to see snow forecasted! Being typical Aussies, neither of us had seen snow before, so we were keen to see if the forecast would come to fruition.\nDay 5\nJR Passes and Imperial Gardens # Our last full day in Tōkyō started early with a 7:30 am train to obtain our JR passes. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know, JR passes allow tourists to pay a flat rate for unlimited travel on most Japanese train lines over a set period of time. Although it isn\u0026rsquo;t super cheap, it does end up saving you money if you are planning on travelling between multiple cities and on JR lines within cities. At least it did, because as of October 2023, the prices have skyrocketed, and now it\u0026rsquo;s only worth it if you\u0026rsquo;re doing tons of long-distance travel. We used about 10ish shinkansens on our trip and even that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be worth it now. RIP JR pass, you were good while you lasted. You can use an online calculator to see if it\u0026rsquo;s worth it for you.\nAs we paid for our passes before we left Australia, we needed to take our paperwork to a JR pass office to activate and obtain our passes. We originally planned to do this at Shinjuku Station, but we were a bit early as we planned to embark on our day trip to Nikkō（日光）as early as possible. We headed to Tōkyō Station instead as their office opened earlier. After a short wait, we had our passes and were ready to go! Our unexpected trip to Tōkyō Station was worth it \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe such a big, busy station is tucked away inside a stunning heritage building.\nBut alas, it was not meant to be. In hindsight we could have made it work, but the combination of our first time using the ticket machine and the time crunch of having a train to catch led us to believe that despite having our JR passes, we still had to pay around $200 to go to Nikkō. This was one of the (thankfully few) stressful moments of the trip, so after throwing in the towel, we took a breather and decided to make the most of our day in Tōkyō instead. Here is a picture of us looking sad about missing out on Nikkō:\nLuckily for us, Tōkyō Station is a short walk away from the Imperial Palace (皇居) and its surrounding gardens. On our way we made a pit stop at Starbucks \u0026ndash; our first Japanese Starbucks experience! Tristan tucked into a matcha donut and a cappuccino, while Soph had a caramel frappuccino and New York cheesecake.\nAfter we finished our breakfast, we stumbled upon a park where we spotted a lone swan in a river. We love an unbothered queen, claiming an entire river as her own.\nAfter finally reaching the Palace gates, we quickly realised that getting inside the palace area, where the emperor lives, was a bit tricky without a guided tour. So, we stayed on the outskirts and enjoyed the gardens instead.\nDespite the rain, runners were out in full force in one section of the gardens. Even though it looks the same as the rest of the gardens area, this specific spot was the runners area for some reason. You do you, babes.\nAfter a bit more wandering in the rain, we found ourselves in a different park. The sun soon emerged, bathing everything in a gorgeous, warm glow.\nWe then headed back to our hotel for a much-needed nap, but not without first stopping for snacks, of course! Soph had a pizza bao, which was absolutely delicious, while Tristan opted for a chicken thigh skewer. It was then that Soph found her favourite peach-flavoured drink of the trip.\nWe brought our food back to the hotel room like the gremlins we are, and then promptly fell into a food coma.\nWhile Soph slept for a few hours, Tristan had a shorter nap and did some planning for our upcoming trip to Kyōto (京都). Our chaotic morning was a good reminder that we needed to be more organised for the rest of our trip. We also booked tickets for the Kyōto Aquarium (京都水族館), which we were super excited about!\nLater on, we ventured out into Shinjuku at night after trying to figure out our hotel\u0026rsquo;s Japanese washing machine (which proved difficult to say the least). We decided to try some sushi from a place where you order from a screen and your food is delivered to your table via a conveyor belt. It was a unique experience, and the sushi was delicious! Tristan discovered he likes salmon sushi.\nUnfortunately the only thing available for Soph on her vegetarian diet was cucumber sushi and some french fries. Finding vegetarian food in Japan is a bit tricky, but we at least felt like we were making progress. After doing some research, our favourite resource for plant-based eats in Japan (or anywhere really) is Happy Cow. It has a map and a list of recommendations from other vegos which came in really handy on our trip.\nWe spent the rest of the night walking around, taking photos, and even got some kawaii photos taken at an arcade.\nOn our nighttime stroll we came across a crossing near Shinjuku Station, which was exciting because we had wanted to visit it for a weird reason (very on-brand for us). In the few months before our trip, we often checked the livestream of this particular crossing. As a testament to this weird ritual, we wanted to actually be on the livestream while we were in Tōkyō. We eventually found the spot and got a screenshot of us on the livestream!\nThis crossing was also exciting because it was the home of the famous 3D cat billboard. The billboard features an animated calico cat, which is adorable and sometimes dons a police hat. The billboard itself is an optical illusion of sorts by wrapping around the building\u0026rsquo;s corner, and some clever framing makes the cat seem to extend beyond the bounds of the billboard. It was so cool to see in person!\nShortly after we noticed a cat cafe, which we almost went into until we accidentally stepped on a tatami mat with shoes on and got yelled at. Oops! There was a really cute cat downstairs just chilling on his little steps. That and the cute cat ad we saw back at the hotel made us miss our orange guy at home a little.\nWe finished off the night with our daily Family Mart trip of course. Soph\u0026rsquo;s cream bun and pizza bao obsessions were fed, while Tristan got a meat bun and a beer. We are definitely not creatures of habit\u0026hellip;\nWe ate our tasty little treats in a nearby alleyway. We were blissfully unaware of the truck that had been waiting for us to move for a few minutes \u0026ndash; that Japanese politeness is no joke! We moved on when we realised and headed back to the hotel. We had planned to pack, but we were too tired, so we decided to leave it for the morning. We each had a bath before turning in for the night \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s our new favourite way to end the day.\nOff to Kyōto tomorrow!\n","date":"20 1月 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cities/tokyo/","section":"Cities","summary":"","title":"Tōkyō • 東京","type":"cities"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/","section":"ノートの日本","summary":"","title":"ノートの日本","type":"page"}]
